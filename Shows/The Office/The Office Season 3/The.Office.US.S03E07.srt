1
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:05,588
Hey.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,841
Who are you faxing
so early in the morning?

3
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,054
Kind of hard to explain.

4
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:15,681
I don't have a ton of
contact with the Scranton branch.

5
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:19,894
But before I left, I took a
box of Dwight's stationery.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,481
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,067
from himself

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,902
from the future.

9
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,822
"Dwight, at 8:00 a.m. today
someone poisons the coffee.

10
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,952
"Do not drink the coffee.
More instructions will follow.

11
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,412
"Cordially, Future Dwight."”

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,378
No!

13
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,089
You'll thank me later.

14
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,833
There she is.
Jan Levinson

15
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,209
first thing in the morning.
Michael.

16
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:28,504
Love to start my day
with a hearty bowl of Jan!

17
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,630
Michael.

18
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:35,344
Just call me
Levinson in the morning, baby

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,179
Michael.
Yes.

20
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,477
I'm here to tell you that we
are closing the Scranton branch.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,023
I don't understand.

22
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:50,359
The Board voted last night
to close your branch.

23
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:53,112
On whom's authority?

24
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,406
The Board's.

25
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:58,451
What?

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,955
I'm very sorry. I don't
relish telling you this.

27
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,000
You've been a big part
of this company,

28
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:10,296
and the Board asked me to
thank you for your years of service.

29
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:11,839
You're welcome.

30
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,342
A small number of people will be
transferred to the Stamford branch

31
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,136
and the rest will be getting
severance packages.

32
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:21,849
Am I a "small number" person
or a "severance package" person?

33
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,811
Well, we haven't made final
decisions about personnel yet.

34
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:29,899
But you're
a "severance package" person.

35
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,613
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:39,283
No!

37
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,748
What are they talking about?

38
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,500
I don't know.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,085
Is it serious?

40
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,003
I don't know, Kev.

41
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,589
If you find out anything,

42
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:57,426
call me.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,345
You got it, buddy.

44
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,274
Are you all right, Michael? Do
you want me to get you some...

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,069
No, no, no.
A water or a tissue?

46
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,948
All right. All right.

47
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,534
You know what, I don't get it.
I don't...

48
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,958
I don't get it, because our
numbers aren't that bad,

49
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,292
things are looking up.

50
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,169
It's not
all about numbers, Michael.

51
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,504
Well...
It's about talent.

52
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,215
Oh, you gotta... Josh?

53
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,925
Our CFO believes that Josh...
Josh.

54
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,302
...Is going to play an important
role in our company's future.

55
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,515
Oh, really. What role is that?
King of the stupid universe?

56
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,475
Okay.
Don't do this, Jan.

57
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,729
I think we're finished and
I need to go. We are not...

58
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,481
I would appreciate it if you
would please use discretion

59
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,691
until we get our ducks
in a row.

60
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,527
I know you're mad,
but don't do this to me.

61
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,905
I know I hurt you, but
please do not do this to me.

62
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:03,367
Don't hurt me like I hurt you.

63
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,747
Jan. Jan.

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,129
It is an outrage.
That's all. It's...

65
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,924
They are making
a huge, huge mistake.

66
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,428
Let's see Josh replace
these people.

67
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:26,348
<i>Let's see Josh find
another Stanley.</i>

68
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,393
Do you think Stanleys grow
on trees? Well, they don't.

69
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,687
There is no Stanley tree.

70
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,274
Do you think the world
is crawling with Phyllises?

71
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,486
Show me that farm.

72
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,362
With Phyllises and Kevins

73
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,532
sprouting up all over the
place ripe for the plucking.

74
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,662
Show me that farm.

75
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:53,584
Pictures. Memories.

76
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,880
Look at that.
They grow up so fast.

77
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,801
Hey, stranger.

78
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,178
Don't say that. That just
sounds weird. Please.

79
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,764
Sorry, I just feel like we
haven't talked in a while.

80
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,141
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

81
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,726
Just do your work.

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,312
While you still can.

83
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,493
When you become close with
someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense.

84
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,162
You can read their moods
like a book.

85
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:37,211
And right now, the title of Michael's
book is Something Weird is Going On:

86
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,964
What Did Jan Say?

87
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,468
The Michael Scott Story.

88
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,138
By Michael Scott
with Dwight Schrute.

89
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:52,268
Hey, did you hear about
your friends in Pennsylvania?

90
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,854
Rumor has it that
the Scranton branch is...

91
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,272
Really?

92
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,023
Wow, that's bad.

93
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,236
Sorry.
Scranton branch is closing?

94
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,697
In your face.

95
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,783
Well, I work here now.

96
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,201
Sucker.

97
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,917
Are you okay?

98
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:21,213
Yeah, great, amazing. Best
physical condition of my life.

99
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,048
What did Jan want?

100
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,301
Nothing. Just checking in.

101
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,221
I can't tell you, so...

102
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,639
What can't you tell me?

103
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,516
Nothing, Pam.

104
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,436
What difference does it make? We'll
all be gone in a few weeks anyway.

105
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,979
What?
What?

106
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:39,106
You just said that we're gonna be
gone? Do I have any messages?

107
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,691
Michael, what's going on?

108
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:41,901
I don't know.
What did Jan say to you?

109
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,444
Was she mean to you?
Nothing. No, she...

110
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,029
Okay. Okay.

111
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:48,741
Listen up, everybody,
I have some news.

112
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,580
All I can do right now is
put on a brave face

113
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,749
and go out there
and be their leader.

114
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,000
It's over.

115
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,879
We are screwed.

116
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:04,506
Dunder Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

117
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,468
Michael, we shouldn't be
talking about this

118
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,220
until all the decisions
have been made.

119
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,099
You knew about this all along,
didn't you?

120
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,061
Jan told me just a few minutes
before she told you.

121
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,229
Traitor. You are a traitor.

122
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,440
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

123
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,776
I don't know. Probably not.

124
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,071
This is the worst!

125
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,206
So this has been great!

126
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,585
So let's get back to work and
do the best job that we can.

127
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,047
Toby, I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

128
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,507
All right.

129
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,805
Oh, my God.
You walk so slowly.

130
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,314
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today.

131
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,442
Because I just received this
in the mail.

132
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,363
A thousand business cards with
this address and phone number.

133
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,491
I don't want to blame anyone
in particular.

134
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,410
I think everyone's to blame.

135
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:19,039
If I get to stay and Ryan
is laid off, I will kill myself.

136
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:23,168
Like Romeo + Juliet.
The Claire Danes one.

137
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,504
Stamford, Connecticut!

138
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,257
Stamford, Connecticut!

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,092
What happened?

140
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:33,095
I think the word got out
about Scranton.

141
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,932
Hey, do you know
any more details on that?

142
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,226
Like, is...
Am I transferring here?

143
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,020
You know, nothing's definite.

144
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,273
In fact, you know what...
Excuse me, everyone.

145
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,567
I know there are some rumors
going around,

146
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,944
but nothing is definite.
All right?

147
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,947
You guys have done a great job
getting our numbers up around here.

148
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,200
But until this thing is official,
let's just keep working, huh?

149
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,119
You know, be professional.

150
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:00,706
Ladies and gentlemen, our
fearless leader, Josh Porter!

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,958
Josh, take a bow. Take a bow!

152
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:08,047
I think it would be kind of weird if
everyone from Scranton came here.

153
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:11,008
It'd be like going
to your high school reunion

154
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:12,760
and you saying,
"Hey, I missed you guys."

155
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,344
And then they're all like,
"Oh, don't worry about it.

156
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,805
"We're all going to
move in with you

157
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,265
"forever."

158
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:24,521
Yeah.

159
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,899
Meredith, hello.
Hey.

160
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,401
Tough day?
Yes.

161
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,404
So, listen, I know
you're seeing someone,

162
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,157
but I'm still willing
if you are.

163
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,159
What willing?

164
00:09:37,284 --> 00:09:39,286
You remember.
Like six years ago

165
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:42,623
we said that on our last
day of work that we would

166
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,250
sleep together.

167
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,796
God.

168
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,383
I did not say that.

169
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,596
Was that not you?
No. Not me.

170
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,642
Never mind.

171
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,772
The day just gets
worse and worse.

172
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,777
It's a blessing in disguise.
Actually, not even in disguise.

173
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:15,072
In my fantasy, I always
thought I would slap someone,

174
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,866
make a big speech
and storm out forever.

175
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,828
But this is good, too.

176
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,704
You're kidding?
No.

177
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,540
What does that mean?

178
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:28,961
Well, some of us are fired, and
a few are going to Connecticut.

179
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,965
Do you guys know
who's going where?

180
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,676
Don't worry.
You're going to be fine, Roy.

181
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,263
You're very strong
and capable.

182
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,807
Thanks.

183
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,852
Oh, grow up.

184
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,646
I don't want to work here
without Pam.

185
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:52,401
It'll just be like loading trucks
without any meaning, you know.

186
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:54,862
I couldn't be happier.

187
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,323
I'm gonna take the severance and
retire. My wife and I are gonna travel.

188
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:01,451
I really couldn't be happier.

189
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,498
Feeling nostalgic?

190
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,584
Yeah, nostalgic.

191
00:11:20,804 --> 00:11:24,474
Hey, Mike.
Darryl. Noble Darryl.

192
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,979
Look, I heard about
the office. Tough break.

193
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:32,941
I know, I know. Well,
I'll land on my feet. Yeah.

194
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,943
Don't worry about me.
I wasn't.

195
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,989
So you'll be okay, too. You're
a warrior, you're smart, capable.

196
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:40,782
You'll find something else
and...

197
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,785
Actually, Bob Vance
bought out the warehouse.

198
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,039
So he's keeping on the
whole crew, so we're good.

199
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,625
Awesome.

200
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,501
This is my house.

201
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,379
The CFQ's taking away my house
and giving it to Josh.

202
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,549
And Josh is giving the garage
to Bob Vance.

203
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,264
All right. Listen up.

204
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,310
Some of you may have heard
some rumors about the branch closing.

205
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,479
Like when you said
the branch was closing?

206
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:14,316
But I am not going to
take this lying down.

207
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,652
I have a plan, and I am
going to save our jobs,

208
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:17,736
so just hang in there.

209
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:18,862
Let's go.
Yes!

210
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,822
Oh, good,
you're bringing Dwight.

211
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,617
Yes. This might get ugly
and we need backup.

212
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,370
What's the plan?

213
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:28,997
We go to New York,
confront the CFO.

214
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,999
Show him he's making a
mistake, save the branch.

215
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,834
Can I drive?
No way.

216
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,170
Shotgun!
No, there's no one else.

217
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,505
Still...

218
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:40,342
Thank you very much.

219
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,136
Okay, secretary says
Wallace is away for the day

220
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,554
and won't be coming back
into the office.

221
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,764
Okay. Okay.

222
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:52,688
But do not worry. I have
his home address right here.

223
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,273
Why?

224
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,732
Christmas card list.

225
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,318
You send him cards?
You've never met him.

226
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,029
But when I do, we'll have
something to talk about.

227
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,451
Hey, do you have a second?
Sure, what's up?

228
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,995
I know it's not definite
or whatever,

229
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,665
but do you know who's coming
over here from Scranton?

230
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,875
I honestly don't...
I don't know.

231
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,795
Okay, so is it like Sales
or accountants or...

232
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:19,631
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

233
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,133
What does that mean?

234
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,301
- Hi!
- Jan, hey.

235
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,846
Oh, good, you're both here.
Ready to talk logistics?

236
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,891
I just feel like it could have
been something special

237
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,144
if we could have kept
working together,

238
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:34,271
but I'm gonna go
some place else,

239
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,398
and you're gonna go
some place else.

240
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,443
It just doesn't make sense.

241
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,987
This kind of worked out
perfectly for me.

242
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,488
I got some good experience,

243
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,325
Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

244
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,828
And as far as me
and Kelly goes,

245
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:53,081
I think it's for the best.

246
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:05,177
Okay! This is it!

247
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,765
This is exactly what Michael Moore does.
Famous documentarian.

248
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,893
He goes up to people
with a camera

249
00:14:12,976 --> 00:14:16,355
and he's like, "Why did you
do this? Why did you pollute?

250
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,900
"You are bad, you're a bad
person." It's very dramatic.

251
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:22,694
Although I can't say I was a
big fan of Bowling for Columbine.

252
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:26,615
Because I thought it was gonna
be a bowling movie, like Kingpin.

253
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,122
And it wasn't.
It was something else.

254
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,421
So Josh will be running what is
now called Dunder Mifflin Northeast,

255
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,715
which is all the offices
north of Stamford.

256
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,551
And, Jim, if you want the job,
you'll be his number two.

257
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,720
Wow! Sure, absolutely.
Awesome.

258
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,140
Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry, I'm
gonna have to stop you there.

259
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,352
I will not be taking the job.

260
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,813
What... Excuse me... Why not?

261
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:02,150
As of today, I have accepted a
senior management position at Staples.

262
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,694
Today?

263
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,074
You leveraged your new
position with us into another offer?

264
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,576
Damn it, Josh,
this whole restructuring thing

265
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,079
was based around keeping you.
I...

266
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,332
I'm sorry, all right.
It's done. It's done.

267
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,752
I gotta make some calls.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, Jim.

268
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:28,051
Say what you will about Michael
Scott, but he would never do that.

269
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,516
Okay. All visible points
of access are covered.

270
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:38,270
So, do you know what you're
going to say when he shows up?

271
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,397
I will improvise.
I will speak from the heart.

272
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,942
No. Bad idea.
You need an attack plan.

273
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,070
Here, I'll be him,
you be you. Let's practice.

274
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:49,531
Okay.
All right.

275
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,535
Coming home from work.
Excuse me! Mr. Wallace?

276
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:55,745
David Wallace? Yes.
What is the meaning of this?

277
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,207
Can you tell us why you
are shutting down Scranton

278
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,043
and putting 15 people
out of work?

279
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,421
Well, the branch is no longer
financially viable.

280
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:05,547
It's simple dollars and cents.

281
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,967
Yes, but these are employees,
sir. These are human beings.

282
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,927
Listen, Scott.

283
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:14,181
It's no longer financially viable.
We're losing money, okay?

284
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,726
It's not a charity, it's a business.
And it's a dying business.

285
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,813
Look, the whole business model of
the small, regional paper company

286
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,399
simply doesn't make sense
anymore. Stop. Stop it, just...

287
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,775
Okay, he's not gonna say
any of that.

288
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,196
Well, hey, why not? Because
he'd be intimidated, and I just...

289
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,032
Let's start again. Just be
more scared of me, okay?

290
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,825
Don't touch me this time.

291
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:36,912
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
Coming home from work.

292
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,539
Pam, would you please sign
my company directory.

293
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,208
Are you serious?

294
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,293
Sure.

295
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:55,138
"Kelly. Best wishes.
Love, Pam."

296
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,599
"P.S.

297
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,061
"What a long,
strange trip it's been."

298
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,573
So, we are still
scrambling here,

299
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,536
but it looks like Scranton
is going to absorb Stamford.

300
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
Wow.

301
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,540
And I know that you just left
there a couple months ago,

302
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,751
but we would like to offer you the
number two position at that branch.

303
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,419
Thank you.
Yeah.

304
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:29,881
No, it's just
I'm not sure if I...

305
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,550
Well, to be quite honest
with you, Jan,

306
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,303
I have a few unpleasant
memories of Scranton and...

307
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,389
Michael.

308
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:41,101
No! No, no,
just some personal stuff.

309
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:44,396
And I'm not really ready
to revisit that, I don't think.

310
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,025
Well, please think about it.

311
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,571
And call me, we will do
whatever we can to get you to stay.

312
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,863
Okay.

313
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,415
Hey, Meredith, how're
you holding up? I'm fine.

314
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,958
Hey, did we ever have
a conversation

315
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,252
about doing something
on the last day of work?

316
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,670
Does that ring a bell?

317
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,046
No. I don't think so.

318
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,676
Do you remember hearing a rumor
about me and anybody, last day of work...

319
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,136
Something sexual?

320
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,638
No.

321
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay.

322
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:26,021
I'm kind of okay with it,
actually.

323
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:29,774
Oh, that's good. That's great.

324
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,029
Do you know what
you're going to do then?

325
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,489
Well, you know,
I've got art school.

326
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,868
Oh, that's... Yeah, of course.
You should totally do that.

327
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,119
That's a great idea.

328
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,203
Yeah.

329
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,667
I am. Already.
I started a while ago.

330
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,505
Wow, that's terrific.

331
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,050
That's awesome.

332
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,886
Well, cool.

333
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,723
I'm glad you're doing that.

334
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,186
You can learn a great deal
about a man from his trash.

335
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,482
Case in point,

336
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,068
Satellite TV bill.

337
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,570
Lesson learned? He's rich.

338
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,992
Coffee grounds.

339
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,120
Was he enjoying a delicious,
hot beverage?

340
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:29,584
Or disguising the scent of
cocaine from drug-sniffing dogs?

341
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,421
It's a nice house.

342
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:39,427
Hey, guys, I'm trying to organize
a little group lunch for everybody

343
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,347
since, you know, we're never
gonna see each other again.

344
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,515
Where are we going?

345
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,642
I thought maybe Dee Jay's?

346
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,186
How about Cugino's?

347
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,271
I don't want to go all the way
to Dunmore.

348
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,856
How about Cooper's, then?

349
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,608
No seafood.

350
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,944
But I don't wanna go
to Dee Jay's.

351
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,654
Oh, now all of a sudden
you get picky?

352
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,948
Okay. Forget it.

353
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,326
Hooters.

354
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,452
No.

355
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:06,371
$400 for the CPU.

356
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:07,914
Done.

357
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,261
Here, replenish your fluids.

358
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,230
Where's Michael?

359
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:35,066
He's not here.
I don't know where he is.

360
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,527
Wait...

361
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,905
What's going on here?

362
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,033
We know the branch is closing.
Michael told us.

363
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,496
Oh, God. Okay.
You know what, everybody?

364
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,081
I'm sure there's a better way
to do this,

365
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,791
but I've driven something
like 400 miles today,

366
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,669
and I'm completely exhausted,
so I'm just gonna tell you.

367
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,505
Your branch is not closing.
Stamford is closing.

368
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,842
For the time being, it seems
that all of your jobs are safe.

369
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,761
Yes!

370
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:04,929
Stanley!

371
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:08,391
Is it because of Michael?
Did he actually do something?

372
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,685
Well, reasons are not
important.

373
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,480
Would you just call him, please,
wherever he is and tell him.

374
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,275
Sure. Jan, do you know, is
anyone coming back to Scranton?

375
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:18,943
Back?
Coming to Scranton.

376
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,862
Is anyone coming to Scranton?

377
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,823
You know, we don't know.
Probably a few.

378
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,627
Maybe we should take a break,
get some food.

379
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,462
Negative. We could miss him.

380
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:39,714
I'm really hungry.
Yeah, me, too.

381
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,969
Who is it?
The office.

382
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,304
Are you gonna get it?

383
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:49,641
No, not until I have
some good news for them.

384
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,229
Not until I have
some good news.

385
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,528
Dunder Mifflin Action News.

386
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:05,240
Jim Halpert, will Big Tuna
be transferring to Scranton?

387
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,408
I don't know.

388
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,370
Jan offered me the job, but
I haven't really decided yet.

389
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:14,332
Yeah. Well, even if I don't get
transferred, I'll probably be fine.

390
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,003
Cornell has an extensive
alumni network, so...

391
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,506
We look out for each other.

392
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,925
I'll probably go back
and teach or something.

393
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,636
Where'd you go to college?

394
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,805
Cornell.

395
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,183
That's good.

396
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,355
I guess some new people
might be coming from Stamford.

397
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,732
Which should be fun.
New blood.

398
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,568
Is Jim coming back?

399
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:45,613
That's... I hadn't thought
about it. I don't know.

400
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,576
I just don't want it
to be weird, you know.

401
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,705
I mean, I took his old job
and his old desk.

402
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,332
Yeah, you know,
that might be weird.

403
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,627
Overall, though,
we still all have our jobs,

404
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,795
so good news, right?

405
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,921
Oh, yeah, totally.

406
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:06,467
I am so happy we don't
have to break up now, Ryan!

407
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,470
It is the best day
of my whole life!

408
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,557
I don't know.

409
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,435
I can't explain it.

410
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,903
What are you gonna do?

411
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,740
I really don't know.
How you doing with all this?

412
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:32,827
You know, I'm fine. I'll be
better when I know if I have a job.

413
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,580
You'd actually move
to Scranton?

414
00:23:35,663 --> 00:23:37,790
Yeah, if they let me,
I think I would.

415
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,169
New York City is 45 minutes
down the road from here.

416
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,963
And you wanna move
to Scranton.

417
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,175
I don't know, if I were you,
I'd move to New York.

418
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:53,348
Yeah, you know, I might do that. I
might... Who knows? I might do that.

419
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,107
God!

420
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,777
Hey, Andy!

421
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,278
What's up, Josh?

422
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,155
I just wanted to say thanks,
good luck.

423
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:11,282
Thanks, man, you,
too, totally.

424
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,244
Oh, well.
What can you do?

425
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:18,957
It was nice to have those few
hours when I thought it was over.

426
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,709
Now, I have something
to look forward to.

427
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,672
Hey, Creed. Congratulations.

428
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,049
Thank you.
I made like 1,200 bucks.

429
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:32,345
- Meredith Palmer.
- Hey, gorgeous.

430
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:33,638
Who's this?

431
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,724
Gary Trundell from the old days
who worked in the warehouse.

432
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,809
Oh, hey.

433
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:38,893
Hey, gal, listen.

434
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,895
I heard through the grapevine
that your branch is closing.

435
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,023
That got me to thinking
about our deal. Remember?

436
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,109
Oh, yes.

437
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,487
Well, actually,
the branch is...

438
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,074
Can you be at my place
in 20 minutes? Yes, I can.

439
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,744
Anything?

440
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:57,912
Nothing.

441
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:04,836
What if this doesn't work? What
if the office actually goes under?

442
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:09,507
Then it was an honor
to have worked with you.

443
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,977
All right.

444
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:26,941
Favorite moments in
Dunder Mifflin history. Go.

445
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:32,739
My first day when you hazed me by
spraying me with the fire extinguisher.

446
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,618
That was hilarious. The foam.

447
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,873
My first sale.

448
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:44,459
My promotion to
assistant regional manager.

449
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,961
Our basketball game.

450
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:51,466
And when you took me
to the hospital

451
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,968
and told me
that you cared about me.

452
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,847
All right, okay,
that's enough, that's good.

453
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:01,851
What were
your favorite moments?

454
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,649
All of them. I loved them all.
Every single one of them.

455
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,904
What about when Jan said
the branch was closing?

456
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:15,406
God, Dwight.
Well, it...

457
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,370
Hey, Pam, we're going to Poor
Richard's. Creed's buying shots.

458
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,206
No thanks, guys.
All right.

459
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,749
Have fun, though.
Cool.

460
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:26,876
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.

461
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,419
Really? Where'd you hear that?

462
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,879
Hey, Ryan, you coming?
Well, I was...

463
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,255
Yeah, we'll meet you there.

464
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,840
Awesome. Let's go, Phyll.

465
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,343
I'll tell you later.
Okay.

466
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:36,844
Hey.

467
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,679
Bye.

468
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:43,017
Crazy day, huh?

469
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,519
Yeah.
Yeah.

470
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,437
Man.

471
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,653
I'm really glad you're still
gonna be working here.

472
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:56,489
Yeah, me, too.

473
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:00,910
I mean, it'd be a pain to
have to find another job, SO...

474
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:03,746
Yeah, totally.

475
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,546
All right, I'll see you.
Okay.

476
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,716
I was expecting a
severance, some time off.

477
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,761
But maybe this is good.

478
00:27:19,428 --> 00:27:21,389
Finding another job is a pain.

479
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,017
There's another annoying boss,
another desk.

480
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,645
I'd have to learn everything
all over again.

481
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,775
So, there are reasons to stay.

482
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,997
Hey, I think I am gonna take
that job.

483
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:50,084
And Scranton,
it's not that bad.

484
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,921
So, if they offer you
a job there,

485
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,340
I think you should take it.

486
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,011
Okay, yeah, maybe I will.
Okay.

487
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,471
Yeah, I'm happy he said that.

488
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,349
I mean, I don't think
he's into me or anything,

489
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:11,105
but I'm kind of into him,
so there you go.

490
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:22,283
What are we still doing here?
It's over.

491
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,370
Let's go home. Get the car.

492
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,502
Oh, this was
such a stupid idea.

493
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,547
This was so stupid.

494
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:41,177
I am such a stupid idiot.
I let everybody down.

495
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,223
Everybody hates me.
I lost everybody's jobs!

496
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,267
Nobody likes me anymore!

497
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,561
Oh, my God!
What?

498
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,648
Stamford is closed!
Michael, we're not closed!

499
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:55,858
Stamford is closed!
Stamford is closed!

500
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,069
Is it? We did it!
We did it!

501
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,404
We did it!
You did it!

502
00:29:01,155 --> 00:29:02,490
We did it!

503
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,159
We did it!
Yeah!

504
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,661
We did it!

505
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,205
Right here! Right here!

506
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,086
Yeah, baby!
In your face!

507
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,965
We did it.
Oh, man!

508
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,635
How did we do it?
I don't know. I have no idea.

509
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:24,470
I don't understand.

510
00:29:26,138 --> 00:29:29,100
Well, for a minute there,
I saw myself selling my house,

511
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:32,019
moving to Costa Rica,
learning how to surf.

512
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,647
But Costa Rica
will still be there

513
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:38,693
when I'm 65.
