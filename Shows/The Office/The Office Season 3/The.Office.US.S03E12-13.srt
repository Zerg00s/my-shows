1
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,414
Angela.
What?

2
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,959
That was a voicemail that
corporate left last night.

3
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,461
They did not get
our tax forms.

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,171
Did you send them?

5
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,632
They arrived this morning.

6
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:50,841
Are you sure?

7
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,970
It is a big deal if...
Is it a big deal?

8
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,638
Is it, Kevin?

9
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,100
Do you really not know?

10
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:00,685
Because it is a big deal.

11
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,981
Five of us transferred
from Stamford.

12
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,025
There's two of us left.
Me and Karen.

13
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,529
It's like we're touring Willy
Wonka's Chocolate Factory

14
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:13,239
and dropping off one by one.

15
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:15,950
Well, guess what?

16
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,327
I'm not falling in
a chocolate river.

17
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:27,211
Everything okay?

18
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:29,839
It's fine.
You are in the clear.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,632
Thank you.

20
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,973
I don't want those.

21
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,103
Dwight, care to join us?
Finally.

22
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,896
Thank you.

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,941
Hey, Dwight, pass the
tardy sauce.

24
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,067
Get it, Michael?
Yes.

25
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,360
Okay.

26
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,446
Here is the dream team.

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,489
My sales dream team.

28
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:58,117
Today we are going to team up
for sales calls.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,621
Andy, since this was your
idea, you get to pick first.

30
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, let me think about
this for a minute.

31
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:09,378
Oh, I don't know.
Michael Scott?

32
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,923
PhD. Doctor of sales.

33
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,301
Well, I appreciate
that. That's very gracious of you.

34
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:19,513
Well, it is very gracious of you
to accept. Well, thank you, sir.

35
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:22,892
Okay, now going by seniority.

36
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,644
Phyllis, our resident senior.

37
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,646
We're the same age.

38
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,398
And I'll pick Karen.

39
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,859
Oh, thanks.

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,444
Good.

41
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:37,615
Next up, the Super Fly
himself, Stanley. Pass.

42
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:40,451
You can't pass.
You gotta pick somebody.

43
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,706
I'll take the kid.

44
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,875
I'm very flattered.

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,753
I was his second
choice after pass.

46
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,923
So that just leaves
Dwight and Jim.

47
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,092
Okay, wait. Does anyone
want to trade?

48
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,802
Yeah, I'll trade.

49
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,513
Dwight and I used to go on
sales calls all the time.

50
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,766
In fact, I have a picture
to remember that time.

51
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:05,893
Oh, young Jim.

52
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:09,605
There's just so much I need
to warn you about

53
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,609
and yet, tragically, I cannot.

54
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,946
Sebring by Chrysler.

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,907
A heck of a motor carriage.

56
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,200
- Dwight!
- Yeah?

57
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:22,702
Here you go.

58
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,161
Yeah!

59
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,163
You want shirts on hangers?
Please.

60
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,873
He does your laundry?

61
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,333
Long story.

62
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,794
All right, everybody,
circle up!

63
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,421
Here we go.

64
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,297
You know what this is?

65
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,007
This is The Amazing Race.

66
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:41,178
And you guys are retired Marines,
and you guys are the mother-daughter,

67
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:46,183
and you guys are the gay couple,
and we are the firefighter heroes.

68
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,351
- Are we ready to go?
- Wait.

69
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,354
Amazing Race, like,
the biggest sale wins?

70
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,607
No. We're just gonna rush out,
do the sales thing and come back.

71
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,609
Is there a prize?
Just bragging rights.

72
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,069
Then how is this Amazing Race?

73
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,154
It's just...

74
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,741
It's Amazing Race,
Phyllis, okay?

75
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,410
We're in teams of two
and we're on a mission.

76
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:07,371
All right. So, on your mark.
Get set. Go.

77
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,415
Let's do it.
Come on!

78
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,671
Michael...

79
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,344
Do you have a pole?

80
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,472
Let's go get a broom.

81
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,224
Seriously, are you gonna
sit in the back?

82
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,810
Yeah.
It's the safest part of a car.

83
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,230
In the event of a crash, the
driver always protects his side first.

84
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,403
Here we go.

85
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,365
In order to take down
Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally.

86
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,658
In this case, Michael.

87
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,868
And here's the good news.

88
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,623
Every success I've ever had in
my job or with the lady folk

89
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:57,129
has come from my ability to slowly
and painfully wear someone down.

90
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,257
What's the deal with
Dwight doing your laundry?

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,345
That is a long story.

92
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:10,142
A couple of months ago, Dwight
tried to go behind my back with Jan

93
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,769
and get my job.

94
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,189
And I am now having him
do my laundry as punishment.

95
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:20,277
Wow. That is a long story,
but quite well told, Michael.

96
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,321
I find it very interesting.

97
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,658
Especially the part about
Dwight going behind your back

98
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:28,744
and basically being,
like, a terrible person.

99
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,540
You know, if you want
your laundry done right,

100
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,918
I used to work at Abercrombie,
SO...

101
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,795
Pretty good folder.

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,171
Hey, Pam.

103
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:41,423
Would you like to go with me
to grab a coffee?

104
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,051
Really?
Yeah.

105
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:47,346
I thought you could use some
fresh air and it might be fun.

106
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,306
Okay. Sure.

107
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,474
Okay.

108
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,482
Why are we turning in here?
This is a beauty salon.

109
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:03,195
Hey, do you mind if I take
the lead on this one

110
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,447
and then you can
critique me after?

111
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,949
You want the lead?

112
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,285
Yeah, if you don't mind.
Mind?

113
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,620
Nothing would delight me more.

114
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,924
Leave the keys.

115
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,219
You still do that thing?
Leave the keys.

116
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,451
I think that you have assembled
an amazing team at Scranton.

117
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,369
It's really a pleasure
to be a part of it.

118
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,289
It's like everyone has their
own special skill, you know.

119
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,708
Just like the Super Friends.

120
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,587
Except for Dwight, who's kind
of more of a Super Dud.

121
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,757
I mean, he'd be a Super Friend
if there was a Super Friend

122
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,551
whose super power
was always being late.

123
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,595
You know?

124
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,348
Hawkman.

125
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,644
My plan is taking longer
than I thought,

126
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,938
but I don't give up easily.

127
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,108
I have
walked two marathons, SO...

128
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:25,778
Let's go.

129
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,866
The men's room was disgusting.

130
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,039
After you, sir.
No, thank you.

131
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:38,582
I never let anyone
walk behind me.

132
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,626
Seven out of 10 attacks
are from the rear.

133
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,837
Okay. Well, that still leaves a 30%
chance that I'll attack you from the front.

134
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,006
Yeah, but it'll be
easier to stop.

135
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,592
I can always block the blow.
Or I can counter it...

136
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,560
Angela, you seem so happy.

137
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,190
I bet you wish you were
like this all the time.

138
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,695
This friend of mine...
Let's call her "Noel."

139
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:13,283
She missed this deadline turning
something into corporate in New York.

140
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:17,663
But then this gallant
gentleman, we'll call him "Kurt."

141
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:21,542
He drove all the way to New
York and handed it in for her.

142
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,544
That's... I don't know.

143
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,796
I guess he just really
likes her a lot.

144
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,424
Well, that's great.

145
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,050
Yes, it is.

146
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,973
Hello?

147
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,182
Hey.

148
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,518
Did you catch that up
at Lake Wallenpaupack?

149
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,644
Yeah.

150
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,522
You know, I used to go up
there all the time with my step-dad

151
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:46,191
and I never
caught anything that big.

152
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,319
I caught an
80-pound shark off Montauk.

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,405
That's in the Hamptons.

154
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:53,574
My dad's got a
42-foot Bayliner.

155
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:56,660
Sniped it with a rifle
from the crow's-nest.

156
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,872
Also shot a deer once.

157
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,957
You know what?
Let's get right down to it.

158
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,627
Dunder Mifflin may be just
two rooms and a warehouse,

159
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,212
but what we lack in flash,

160
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,632
we will make up for
with hard work and decency.

161
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,844
Okay, this is the
classic undersell.

162
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:18,098
Because you should know
we don't work out of a log cabin.

163
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,685
We trade on the New York
Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it?

164
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,853
It's in New York.

165
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,024
I have to say I'm a little wary of
getting involved with a big company.

166
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,650
We've had some
problems in the past.

167
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,237
And I think what Andy is
trying to express is that

168
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,074
while we have the resources
of a large company,

169
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,410
we will give you the care and
attention of a small company.

170
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,288
Man, that is like poetry.

171
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:43,373
I swear.

172
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,293
This guy could sell paper
to a tree stump.

173
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,756
I'm so sorry, man.

174
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,176
I really screwed that up.

175
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,844
I really...
No. Don't worry about it.

176
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,846
I really Schruted it.

177
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,139
What?

178
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,724
I Schruted it.

179
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,519
It's just this thing people say
around your office all the time.

180
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,480
Like when you screw something
up in a really irreversible way,

181
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,482
you Schruted it.

182
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,860
I don't know where
it comes from, though.

183
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,904
You think it comes
from Dwight Schrute?

184
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:16,949
I don't know. Who knows
how words are formed.

185
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,618
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

186
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,247
This is Pam.

187
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,291
I did?

188
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,961
Yeah, I did a watercolor of
Francis Willard Elementary School

189
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,921
for a contest
they were having.

190
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,757
They were calling
with the results.

191
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,176
And I won.

192
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,971
I won. My painting won!

193
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,141
So I'd like to thank my mom
for always encouraging me.

194
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,686
And I'd like to thank my dad for
buying me my first set of art pencils.

195
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,857
And I'd like to thank the
sixth-grade class that picked me.

196
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,860
It's a big order.

197
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,611
Thanks, Ken.
Yeah, thank you.

198
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,947
Hey, how's Annie?
She's great.

199
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,908
This is us last year
in Bermuda.

200
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,455
Lovely place.
You ever been to Bermuda?

201
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:09,168
Stanley Hudson.
Julius, how's it going?

202
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,588
Great, great, great.
Stanley, so good to see you.

203
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,839
You, too.

204
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:15,924
I'd like you fellows to
meet Ryan Howard.

205
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:18,677
Hi. Yeah. I'm gonna
let Ryan do a little pitch

206
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,180
for you while I do my
crossword puzzle. Ryan.

207
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,734
Hi. Hi. Hi.

208
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,402
Hello, Ryan.

209
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:36,737
What do you have for us?

210
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,744
We can offer our biggest discounts on
30% recycled and ultra premium laser.

211
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,204
Okay. Okay.

212
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,663
Can I use your phone?

213
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,332
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
Thanks.

214
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,500
Let me talk to you about a few
of the other things we can offer.

215
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,461
Namely, we know that
tax season's coming up,

216
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,546
so by April 1st
we can have you fully stocked.

217
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,590
We have discount prices on
ink cartridges. - One.

218
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,674
Three.

219
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,092
And also any forms
that you're gonna need...

220
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,595
Seven.
...we can custom make them.

221
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,476
Hey, Kev, guess what?

222
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,353
I won an art contest today.

223
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,563
How much did you win?
$100.

224
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:16,944
I won 400 bucks on the
Celtics game last night.

225
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,447
Cool. Congratulations.

226
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,449
Thanks.

227
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:28,330
It was so sweet.

228
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,549
And you just said,
"Hi! Hi! Hi!"

229
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:46,098
You sounded like my niece.

230
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:48,308
And she's six months old!

231
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,646
Well, I appreciate
what you guys are saying,

232
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:55,148
but it makes more fiscal sense
to go with one of the big guys.

233
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,483
Sure.
That's true.

234
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:57,693
We can't compete
with their prices.

235
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,902
But let me ask you something.

236
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,280
How important to you is
customer service? Very.

237
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,491
Please keep
holding. Your call is very important to us.

238
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:08,787
That's one of the big guys.
Been on hold this whole time.

239
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,248
And this is Dunder Mifflin.

240
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,459
Dunder Mifflin
customer service. This is Kelly.

241
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,919
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.

242
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,922
Oh, my God! Jim! How are you?
I wanted to tell you...

243
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,340
Here's my card.

244
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,967
It's got my cell number,
my pager number,

245
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,719
my home number
and my other pager number.

246
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,429
I never take vacations.
I never get sick.

247
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,472
And I don't celebrate
any major holidays.

248
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,308
All right. I get it.

249
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,435
We got a deal.
All right.

250
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,065
Hey, Angela, I got
good news today, too.

251
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,776
I won an art contest.

252
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:41,695
That's great, Pam.

253
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,741
I like having these
little moments with you.

254
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:50,954
You know what? Sprinkles
recently had kittens.

255
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,458
I would like to offer you
the dominant male.

256
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,626
His name is Ash.

257
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:05,260
I don't think so. But thanks.

258
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:10,390
My building manager is...

259
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,769
You understand.

260
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:18,398
Well then, have a nice day.

261
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,488
Thanks. That was fun.

262
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:28,492
Yeah. I really enjoy spending time
with you. You're a very nice person.

263
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:29,910
Thank you.

264
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,870
I'm so glad you're with Jim.

265
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,790
He was hung-up on Pam
for such a long time.

266
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,168
I didn't think
he'd ever get over her.

267
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,297
That's nice.

268
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,968
You can pay me back later
for the makeover.

269
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,813
- Hey, boss. Got a minute?
- Yes, Andy.

270
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,816
I forget. Why did Dwight
say he was late this morning?

271
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,526
He didn't say.
That's weird.

272
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,029
Because I was just walking
past his desk and I saw this,

273
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,241
which is a toll booth receipt
from New York City,

274
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:11,118
stamped really early
this morning.

275
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:13,370
So...

276
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,582
Why would Dwight go to New
York without telling anyone?

277
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,043
You think he went to see Jan?

278
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,587
That's not like him, is it?

279
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,844
Someone told me a story about
this... With like laundry and betrayal.

280
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:34,182
Did you betray Dwight and try
to steal his job or something?

281
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,308
No.

282
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:38,145
You are remembering it wrong.

283
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,440
Dwight betrayed me
once before.

284
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,109
So this is his strike two.

285
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,278
You know what they say?

286
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,363
"Fool me once, strike one.

287
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,949
"But fool me twice,

288
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:54,453
"strike three."

289
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,000
Dwight's name is on
the security sign-in sheet,

290
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,961
but I don't know
who he met with.

291
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,880
And where it asks to
state your business,

292
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,340
he wrote, "Beeswax
Not Yours Incorporated.”

293
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,758
I knew it.

294
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:14,806
Oh, doggie.

295
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,935
Hey, you wanna grab a coffee?

296
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,937
Sure.

297
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,731
Look at you.

298
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,357
Yeah.

299
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,319
Beesly, coffee?

300
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:29,321
No, thanks, I had
some already. All right.

301
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,614
But, hey, Jim.
Yeah?

302
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,074
I won an art contest today.

303
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,951
No way!
Yeah.

304
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,537
All right, Pam.
Congratulations. Thanks.

305
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,663
Which one was it?

306
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,832
I sent them one of
my watercolors. Cool.

307
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,752
It was a new one I did.
Are you ready, Jim?

308
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:46,087
Yeah. Can I see it
when I get back? Yeah.

309
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,506
Congratulations.
Thanks.

310
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,590
Big deal.

311
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,017
Hey! We nailed the sale.

312
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,519
Where were you this morning?

313
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,688
I overslept.
Damn rooster didn't crow.

314
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,691
Why do you lie, liar?
I'm not a liar.

315
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,653
You are lying right now.
Sure seems like he's lying.

316
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,196
Stay out of this, you!

317
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,615
I know that you went
to corporate this morning.

318
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:16,785
And I know that you
lied about it.

319
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,122
And given our history, I need
you to tell me right now

320
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:24,209
exactly what you
were doing this morning.

321
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,336
Michael, I cannot tell you
what I was doing there.

322
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,338
But you have to trust me.

323
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:31,758
I would never do anything
to hurt you or this company.

324
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,051
Okay, you know what?

325
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,720
I want you to think about your
future at this company.

326
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,681
I want you to think about it
long and hard.

327
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,599
That's what she said.
Don't...

328
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,476
Don't you dare.

329
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,982
I want to know what you were doing
this morning by the end of the day.

330
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,781
It's gonna be okay.

331
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,033
How's it gonna
be okay, Dwight?

332
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,077
Everyone will know
our business.

333
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,912
Well, that's not the
worst thing in the world.

334
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,458
I'll just stand up in front of the
office and reveal our true love.

335
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,588
It won't be that bad.
Look at Kelly and Ryan.

336
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:14,259
I hate those two people more
than anything in the entire world.

337
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,220
Well, I don't have
a lot of choices.

338
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,600
So, let me ask
you a question. Okay.

339
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,352
Did you ever have
a thing for Pam?

340
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,940
Pam? Did I ever have
a thing for her? No.

341
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,193
Why? Did she say something?

342
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,280
I moved here from Connecticut.

343
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,781
Yeah.

344
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
Okay, here's the...

345
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:46,041
I had a crush on her
before I left.

346
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,462
And I told her about it and
she didn't feel the same way.

347
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:53,632
So it didn't amount
to anything and I left.

348
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,429
I'm really glad you're here.

349
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,056
Okay?

350
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,516
Okay.

351
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,816
May I have your
attention, please?

352
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,404
This will only take a
moment of your time.

353
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,159
"Although I love this company more
than almost anything in the world,

354
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:25,246
"I have decided to step down from my
post and spend more time with my family.

355
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,165
"I do not fear the unknown.

356
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:30,752
"I will meet my new challenges
head on and I will succeed.

357
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:33,838
"And I will laugh in the faces
of those who doubt me.

358
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,591
"It's been a pleasure working
with some of you

359
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,010
"and I will not forget
those of you soon.

360
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:42,013
"But remember,
while today it is me,

361
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,850
"we all shall fall."

362
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,898
In other words,
I'm quitting, so...

363
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:56,778
Oompa, Loompa,
doom-pa-dee-dawesome

364
00:19:57,195 --> 00:20:00,949
Dwight is now gone,
which is totally awesome

365
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,034
Why was he gone?

366
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,036
He was such a nice guy

367
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,663
No, he was not

368
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:08,707
He was a total douche

369
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,792
Doompa-dee-doom

370
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,841
I would like to give the rest of
my belongings to Michael Scott.

371
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,302
Just take it.

372
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,804
Except this.

373
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,640
Good luck.
And this one.

374
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,520
Dwight will be missed.

375
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,442
Not by me so much,
but he will be missed.

376
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,654
Dwight from sales

377
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,116
was one of the most honorable
and efficient employees

378
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,076
this company has ever had.

379
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,122
One of my life goals
was to die right here in my desk chair.

380
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,752
And today, that dream
was shattered.

381
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,382
Hey, man.

382
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,773
What happened
on your sales call?

383
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,236
Am I happy about
the way things turned out?

384
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,657
Oh, "Happy's"
such an ugly word,

385
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,538
but I saw what needed to be
done and I did it and now I'm thrilled.

386
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,499
So, it's pretty...

387
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,626
Hello?

388
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,961
Pretty good.

389
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,384
I have left Dunder Mifflin
after many record-breaking years,

390
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,971
and I'm officially on the job
market and it's very exciting.

391
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,849
For your convenience, I've
broken it down into three parts.

392
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,895
Professional resume, athletic
and special skills resume

393
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,189
and Dwight Schrute trivia.

394
00:21:56,272 --> 00:22:00,068
I am ready to face any challenges
that might be foolish enough to face me.

395
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,904
How would I describe myself?
Three words.

396
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:07,408
Hardworking, alpha male,
jackhammer.

397
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,329
Merciless, insatiable.

398
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,790
There's nothing on my horizon
except everything.

399
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:15,583
Everything is on my horizon.

400
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,462
I got this job to make some money
while I continue my employment search.

401
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,924
And it's fine for
the time being.

402
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,927
Break's over.

403
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,478
Big Turkey?

404
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,487
He rocks in the treetop
all a day long

405
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,698
Hoppin' and a-boppin'
and a-singin' the song

406
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:47,907
All the little birds on...

407
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,158
Is that you singing?

408
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,536
All four parts.
Recorded it on my computer.

409
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:53,371
Wow.
Took me forever.

410
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,791
Nice job.
Thank you muchly.

411
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:01,045
Oh rockin' robin well you
really gonna rock tonight

412
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:02,797
Every little swallow...

413
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,090
You gonna answer it?

414
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,259
Every little bird in
the tall oak tree

415
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:07,802
I called it myself.

416
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:10,013
Just thought you'd get a kick
out of the new ring.

417
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:11,264
Yikes.

418
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:14,601
Side note, just like to say I'm thrilled
to be working directly beneath you.

419
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,936
Cool. I feel I have a
lot to learn from you,

420
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,398
even though you're younger
and have less experience.

421
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:25,904
So here's to the future,
Andy and the Tuna.

422
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,574
Andy and the Tuna

423
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,164
Oh, what a duo, magical
Andy and the Tuna

424
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,709
I miss Dwight.

425
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,590
Congratulations, universe,
you win.

426
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,928
Yes, Dwight Schrute has left the
company. More personnel turnover.

427
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,721
Cost of doing business.

428
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:55,975
Yeah, well, it is a big loss.
Dwight was the top salesman.

429
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,478
Was the top salesman.
I said "was."

430
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:01,522
Right,
addition by subtraction.

431
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,734
What does that even mean?
That is impossible.

432
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,987
Yeah, you're right.

433
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,992
But there is some good news.
Oscar is back, addition by addition.

434
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,496
So we are going to have a big
party today to welcome him back,

435
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:19,791
and hopefully, that'll lift
everyone's spirits.

436
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,125
Hi, everyone.

437
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,504
Oh, hello, Oscar.
How was your gaycation?

438
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:26,130
That's very funny.

439
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:30,426
Yeah? I thought of that like
two seconds after you left.

440
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,767
Hi, Angela.

441
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,061
Oscar.

442
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,648
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, what's up?

443
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,608
Nothing.

444
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:53,116
Man. TGI Wednesday.

445
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:55,243
Am [ right?

446
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:59,497
Gonna go home, get my beer on,
get my Lost on.

447
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:02,291
What're you doing later?
You wanna hang out?

448
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,169
Oh, I don't know, maybe.

449
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,879
Well, I'll take that
as a maybe.

450
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,806
Where're you going?
Bathroom.

451
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,766
Oh, I'm going to the kitchen,
I'll walk with you.

452
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:27,400
Things are going pretty good.

453
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,652
Getting a lot of
face time with the boss.

454
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:37,785
Oscar, I have a question.

455
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,748
Would you like to join
the Party Planning Committee?

456
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,666
The committee with
all the women? Yeah.

457
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,628
Because I'm gay?
No, no.

458
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:54,135
Certain events have transpired
and I've thought about certain things,

459
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:58,598
and I'm sorry for the way
those certain events transpired.

460
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,020
And I would just like to make
some changes about certain things.

461
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,814
And certain situations
and certain accounts.

462
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,317
Okay, okay. All right, all
right, I'll join. I'd love to.

463
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,611
That's... Thank you.

464
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:12,945
Thank you.
Thank you.

465
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,451
Can I join, too?

466
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,329
Never.

467
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:24,874
You sell those two printers
this morning? Nice work.

468
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,710
Child's play. Give me
something hard to sell.

469
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:33,883
Wow, what is wrong with
this thing? It looks terrible.

470
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,843
Do you want me to ask
the night cleaning crew

471
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,095
if they stopped watering it?

472
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,474
Yeah. Oh, you know what? Ask
them about the toys on my desk, too.

473
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,853
They always used to arrange the
toys on my desk in a very pleasing way.

474
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,313
It used to brighten
my morning.

475
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,566
Oh, that wasn't the night
crew. That was Dwight.

476
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,613
Really?
That was very nice of him.

477
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:58,658
We need more attitude
like that around this office.

478
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,994
Feel you, dawg.
Yeah, do you?

479
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,914
Absolutely.
What did I say?

480
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:08,167
You said...

481
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,715
Which is like... Right on. Pam
was like, "Blah, blah, blah,"

482
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,968
and you're like, "Yeah."

483
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,595
Nailed it.

484
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,604
Wow.

485
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:33,609
Love that Andy, right? Solid
fellow. Seems smart enough.

486
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:34,777
Likes me a lot.

487
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,864
A lot? Too much.

488
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,118
Like a crazy person a little.

489
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,995
Not super crazy, just...

490
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,540
There's something about him
that creeps me out.

491
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:48,624
I can't really explain it.

492
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,627
He's always up in my biznezz,

493
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:57,258
which is Ebonics for being in my face
and annoying the bejesus out of me.

494
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:03,264
I don't understand how someone
can have so little self-awareness.

495
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:13,065
I really have no preference. We
don't even have to have a party.

496
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,904
No, hey. Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Of course we're going to have a party.

497
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:21,782
The celebration of Oscar.
Oscar night.

498
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,659
And I wanted to be
Oscar specific.

499
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,871
Michael... No. No, I mean,
not because you're gay.

500
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:29,373
Your gayness
does not define you.

501
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,293
Your Mexicanness is what
defines you to me.

502
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:35,922
And I think we should
celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity.

503
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,552
So, Phyllis, I want you to
go find firecrackers

504
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,346
and a Chihuahua.

505
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,265
Pam, in the
frozen food section,

506
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,476
Swanson makes a
delightful chimichanga.

507
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,479
Why don't you have me riding in
on a donkey into the office, Michael?

508
00:28:51,562 --> 00:28:53,147
Would that be good?
A burro.

509
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,775
Of course, if Oscar wants
a donkey, let's get him one.

510
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:01,572
Need any help?

511
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:04,909
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm just looking.

512
00:29:05,117 --> 00:29:06,118
Great.

513
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:15,002
I will literally be standing right
here if you need anything at all.

514
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:19,799
Think I could go for some
tuna fish right about now.

515
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,635
Got my rod here.

516
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:32,520
Click, click, click, click.
Click, click, click, click.

517
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,065
Click, click, click, click.

518
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:43,364
Hey.

519
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:48,619
Hey, so Andy is in
rare form today.

520
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:51,122
Yeah, you should not
encourage him.

521
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,584
Encourage him? I'm the
victim, okay? He's fishing for me.

522
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,295
We gotta do something.

523
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,923
Look, I've got like 15 new clients
that I've inherited from Dwight

524
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:05,344
and each file is password protected with
a different mythical creature, so...

525
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:08,723
I'm sorry. I can't.

526
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:10,224
Fine.

527
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:12,393
Party pooper.

528
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,821
Who's that
sportscaster that bit that lady?

529
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:25,656
Mar-something?

530
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:31,120
Andy is like Mar-something.
Great sportscaster, big weirdo creep.

531
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,707
185-pounder. Check it out.

532
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,213
Hey, guys.

533
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,132
How's the workload?

534
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,595
All of Dwight's old accounts.
Handling it okay?

535
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,555
Sort of.
He had a lot of clients.

536
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:51,724
Yes, he did.

537
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:55,144
Have any of you
talked to Dwight?

538
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:57,229
Oh, sure,
we talk all the time.

539
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,939
Really?
No.

540
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,734
Don't do that. It's not nice.

541
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,237
What about you, Phyllis?
You and Dwight were close.

542
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,406
No, sorry.

543
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,369
Dwight had a big personality
and I have a big personality.

544
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:15,581
And a lot of times when two people like
that get together, it can be explosive.

545
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,461
Really coming down out there.
The commute's gonna be hell.

546
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,631
I have snow tires and chains,

547
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,050
plus exceptional
hand-eye coordination.

548
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,888
So, where were you
working before this?

549
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,767
Dunder Mifflin.
What kind of company is that?

550
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:37,728
Paper company.

551
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,065
We're only one of Staples'
top competitors in the area.

552
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,610
I never heard of them.

553
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:47,363
Oh, really?
Have you heard of paper?

554
00:31:48,864 --> 00:31:50,241
It's gonna be like that, huh?

555
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,912
I don't like him, his giant
head, or his beady, little eyes.

556
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:56,997
That's all I got to
say on the matter.

557
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,169
In your head

558
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,047
in your head

559
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:08,384
Zombie, Zombie

560
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:12,096
Zombie

561
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:15,307
In your head

562
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,561
Would you like to pull
a prank on Andy?

563
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:20,771
I'm kind of in the middle...
Yes, please.

564
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,940
Okay, good. Stay right here.

565
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,693
Zombie

566
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,070
In your head

567
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:31,198
Sorry about that.
Oh, smooth move, Tuna.

568
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,159
Nice one.

569
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,206
Are there any messages?

570
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,749
So weird.

571
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,255
Nice to have Oscar back.

572
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,633
Yeah.

573
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:36,472
He rocks in the treetop
all a day long

574
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:39,183
Hoppin' and a-boppin'
and a-singin' the song

575
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:45,356
Large Tuna, have you seen
my cell phone device?

576
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,527
'Cause someone is
calling right now. No.

577
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:50,736
There is a call.

578
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:53,113
...well you really
gonna rock tonight

579
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,407
Every little swallow...

580
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,549
Angela.

581
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,012
Is everything okay?

582
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,557
No.

583
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,150
He rocks in the treetop...

584
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,652
What's going on?

585
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,070
What're you talking about?

586
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:36,240
Where is my freaking phone?

587
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,117
Love to hear
the robin goin'...

588
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,868
You know what?
Maybe it's in the ceiling.

589
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,371
You know what?
Maybe you're in the ceiling.

590
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:43,747
Okay.

591
00:34:45,624 --> 00:34:47,334
I don't trust you, Phyllis.

592
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,338
Every little swallow,
every chickadee

593
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,549
I wanted to let you know that
Dwight was late that morning

594
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:56,260
because he had to drive to New
York to drop off the quarterly tax forms

595
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,386
that I forgot to send.

596
00:34:58,178 --> 00:35:01,223
Why would Dwight
do that for you?

597
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,184
I think I know why.

598
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,228
Because Dwight
loves this company.

599
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:11,191
Do you think that anyone else out
there would've driven to corporate for you?

600
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,487
None of them.
Especially not Andy.

601
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,909
Oh rockin' robin well you
really gonna rock tonight

602
00:35:32,504 --> 00:35:36,050
Pam, I have a mission to accomplish.
Make sure this party gets rolling

603
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:37,676
and I will be back shortly.

604
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,638
Where are you going?
Want me to come with?

605
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,141
Listen, I forgot to tell you
the plan for this Saturday.

606
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:47,478
You, me, bar, beers, buzzed.

607
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,106
Wings, shots, drunk.
Waitresses, hot.

608
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,026
Football, Cornell, Hofstra.
Slaughter.

609
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:57,237
Then, quick nap at my place
and we hit the tizzown.

610
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,865
No.
I don't wanna do any of that.

611
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,869
Duh. Which is why I
was joking about doing it.

612
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:06,664
No, just stop. Stop.
Just stop doing it.

613
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,082
You're going to
drive me crazy.

614
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,795
Fine, I'll just go sit at
my desk and be quiet.

615
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,672
Sorry I annoyed you
with my friendship.

616
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,553
Excuse me.

617
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,305
He rocks in the treetop
all a day long

618
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:28,894
And I'm also sorry that a lot of people
here for some reason think it's funny

619
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:32,356
to steal someone's personal
property and hide it from them.

620
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,109
Here's a little news flash.

621
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,735
It's not funny!

622
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,614
In fact, it's pretty
freaking un-funny!

623
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,159
Every little swallow,
every chickadee

624
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,661
God!

625
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:49,123
The wise old owl
and the big black crow

626
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,541
Flapping them wings...

627
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,796
That was an overreaction.

628
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:59,049
Gonna hit the break room.
Does anybody want anything?

629
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:02,052
Pam, you good?

630
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,012
Yeah.
Sure? Okay.

631
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,202
Well, that
question IS meaningless.

632
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,913
Just go with the copy paper,
it's your funeral.

633
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,999
See how that
works out for you.

634
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:36,462
Hey.

635
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,673
What's up?
Hey.

636
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:43,635
Same old.

637
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:57,733
It takes a big man to admit his
mistake, and I am that big man.

638
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,904
Angela from accounting
told me what you did.

639
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,656
Oh, my God, she told you?
Yes, she did.

640
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,116
And, Dwight,

641
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:11,955
if you were willing to do something
like that for some random co-worker,

642
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:16,376
then clearly, I misjudged you
from the beginning.

643
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,547
And I apologize.

644
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,219
Accepted.

645
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,017
How's this place treating you?

646
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:34,937
My boss isn't funny.

647
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,689
I don't get to wear my ties.
No.

648
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,775
Sure. So...

649
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:42,152
So maybe you should come back.

650
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:45,823
You should come back. Please.

651
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,619
I don't wanna do
your laundry anymore.

652
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:52,913
We can talk about that.

653
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:01,421
All right.

654
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,811
Oh, my God.
That's half-inch dry wall.

655
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,438
I think we broke his brain.

656
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:22,651
"It's not freaking funny!"

657
00:39:24,736 --> 00:39:28,156
You really enjoying your
fiesta? Actually, yeah.

658
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,119
I didn't think I would
but turns out it's great.

659
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:35,747
Ladies and gentlemen, may
I present Mr. Dwight Schrute.

660
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:44,172
Welcome back.
Thank you.

661
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,347
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of
her hand. You're gonna break it.

662
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,474
Not bad, huh?

663
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,227
You did this for me?

664
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,647
Guilty.

665
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:08,363
Hey.

666
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,997
Do you still have
feelings for her?

667
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:25,297
Yes.

668
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:44,524
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big finale.

669
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,235
Sir, would you do the honor?

670
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,446
Oh, man.

671
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,618
No, no, no, no.
I don't need it.

672
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:06,004
It takes a big man to
admit his mistake and that's what I did.

673
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:09,466
The important thing is,
I learned something.

674
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:13,887
I don't want somebody
sucking up to me

675
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,807
because they think I'm going
to help their career.

676
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:23,355
I want them sucking up to me
because they genuinely love me.

677
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:29,903
So Michael had a little chat
with corporate

678
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,198
and they decided to send me
to management training.

679
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:38,829
Anger management, technically,
but still, management material.

680
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:40,998
This whole thing's supposed
to take 10 weeks.

681
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,290
I expect to be done in five.

682
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:46,628
How? Name repetition, personality
mirroring and positive reinforcement

683
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,797
through nods and smiles.

684
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,676
So don't worry about old
Andy Bernard. I'll be back.

685
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,219
Just like Rambo.

686
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:55,387
Oh, hi, you must be Andy.

687
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,849
Oh, hi. Yes, I am,
and you must be Marcy.

688
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:00,392
That's right, it's so
good to meet you.

689
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:01,977
It's so good to meet you.

690
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,396
Thanks. Well, you ready
to have some fun? Yeah.
