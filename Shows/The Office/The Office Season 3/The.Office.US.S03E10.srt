1
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,215
Merry Christmas!

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,758
Merry Christmas... No!

3
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,385
Why did you
bring that here?

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,846
Don't worry, she's dead.
Oh, wait.

5
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:15,597
He's dead.

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,307
Dwight? What...

7
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:19,476
I accidentally
ran over it.

8
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,978
It's a Christmas miracle.

9
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,104
Well, get it out of here.

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,982
Relax, okay? And
because this is Christmas,

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,526
I am going to
roast this goose

12
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,154
and prepare it with
a wild rice dressing.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,406
Do we have any cayenne pepper
in the kitchen?

14
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:35,492
Merry Christmas, Dwight.
Jim.

15
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:36,785
Wow. What do we
got here?

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,120
What does it look like?

17
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,038
Dead goose.

18
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,289
And circle gets the square.

19
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,582
All right.

20
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,876
So, can you watch this?
I'm gonna get

21
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,252
my carving knife
out of the trunk.

22
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,920
Oh, Dwight,
we talked about this.

23
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,463
No, Toby,
this is different.

24
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,090
He's already dead.

25
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:55,258
Once I brought in a duck to prepare
for lunch, and people got upset.

26
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,641
Apparently they got
attached to the duck

27
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:00,476
and didn't want
to see it killed.

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,602
He was already dead,

29
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,188
and we Schrutes use
every part of the goose.

30
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,275
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

31
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,193
Plus, you can use
the molten goose grease,

32
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,736
and save it in
the refrigerator,

33
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,321
thus saving you
a trip to the store

34
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,989
for a can of
expensive goose grease.

35
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:15,407
Wow. Win-win.

36
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:16,867
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.

37
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,369
I like goose.
And it's already dead.

38
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:19,953
Is it so crazy
if we eat it?

39
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,080
That's crazy.
It's crazy.

40
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,124
Dwight, you cannot
keep that here.

41
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:27,961
Okay, that is ridiculous, and
totally against the spirit of Christmas.

42
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:33,049
Come on, Dwight, we went
over this, like, for half an hour.

43
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,469
It's Christmas, Toby.

44
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,721
It's a dead animal in
our office. You can't...

45
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,306
Toby...

46
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,557
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,603
Please. Please.

48
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,317
Clean it in your car.

49
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,028
I would like it
off my desk.

50
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,655
Oh, Pam, take a chill pill.

51
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:32,234
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

52
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,862
Fa, Ia,
la, la, Ia, Ia, Ia, la, la

53
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,781
'Tis...

54
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:43,241
Hey! I would like a nice
slice of Christmas Pam.

55
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,250
Side of candied Pams.

56
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,878
And perhaps,
some Pam chops...

57
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,128
Can I help you, Michael?

58
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:53,380
...with mint.

59
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,424
I'm looking for
the Toy Drive box.

60
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,510
It's behind you.
Okay.

61
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,805
Well, I need to put
this bike in there.

62
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,891
I hope it will fit, with all
these little knick-knacks.

63
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:06,518
Wow. What kind
of bike is that?

64
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:08,812
I don't know.
Average kind.

65
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:11,189
The tires look pretty worn.

66
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,566
Well, that is
probably from the test drive.

67
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,402
But the paint's chipping.

68
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,279
Is that your
old bike, Michael?

69
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,530
No.

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,823
Yo, Michael.
Sweet ride, Mike.

71
00:03:19,907 --> 00:03:21,283
Oh, thanks.

72
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,162
Michael?
Yes?

73
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,415
Oh, Pam, that is so sweet.

74
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,626
You didn't have to do that.

75
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,586
I didn't.
It's from corporate.

76
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,962
Okay. Did everybody
get one of these?

77
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,380
Yep.

78
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,174
Terrific. Good.

79
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,677
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

80
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,554
My girlfriend, Carole, is
coming to our party tonight

81
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:45,557
and I have
a little surprise for her.

82
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:50,141
I've got two
tickets to paradise

83
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,316
Pack your bags We're
leaving day after tomorrow

84
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,153
I'm taking her to Sandals,
Jamaica, all-inclusive.

85
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,364
All-inclusive.

86
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:02,699
You know what
that means, right?

87
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,576
Yeah!

88
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:14,211
I think you're supposed to
put a toy in the box, Creed.

89
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,338
And a happy holiday to you.

90
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:23,929
Carole.

91
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,055
Hi. Is Michael
around here?

92
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,393
There she is!
A Christmas Carole. Hello.

93
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,439
You're about five
hours early to the party.

94
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:34,981
Oh, you're such a blonde.

95
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,608
Michael...

96
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:41,071
Hey, everybody? I don't
know who you haven't met yet,

97
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,406
but I think this
is one of them.

98
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,325
This is my girlfriend,
Carole.

99
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,285
This is just
the front of her.

100
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,870
Show them the other side.

101
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:49,287
What?

102
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:52,082
Turn around.
Turn around. Come on.

103
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,168
Get out of here!
No, you get out of here.

104
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:55,252
Michael?
Yes.

105
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:58,714
If I may say, she's even
prettier than you described her.

106
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,176
Oh, ouch! Michael, I don't
think there's anything wrong

107
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:04,135
with the way
you described her.

108
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,262
Thank you.

109
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,388
I really need
a moment alone with you.

110
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,184
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

111
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:14,979
What is this?

112
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,566
That is my Christmas card.

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,485
It's a picture of you
and me and your kids

114
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,528
on a ski trip,
having a blast.

115
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,030
"Ski-eason's Greetings."

116
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,031
No. See,
we never went on a ski trip.

117
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,117
I know. I know.

118
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,660
I went on a ski trip...
Right.

119
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,163
...two years ago with my kids
and my ex-husband.

120
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,666
Yes, but what you
didn't realize at the time

121
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,252
was that I was
with you, in a sense.

122
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,753
I was in your heart...

123
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,755
Michael... ...and next
to your kids. What?

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,632
This is so weird.

125
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,883
I don't understand.

126
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,844
It's a bold move to
Photoshop yourself

127
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,472
into a picture with your
girlfriend and her kids

128
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,559
on a ski trip
with their real father.

129
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,644
But then again,
Michael's a bold guy.

130
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,854
Is "bold" the right word?

131
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,147
I think you're
a really sweet guy.

132
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,482
Okay.

133
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,069
But I don't know
how to deal with

134
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,156
this thing, and the proposal,

135
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,575
and I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

136
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,160
No. No,
no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay.

137
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,245
You know what?

138
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,412
You're not thinking straight.

139
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,622
You know what you need?

140
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,084
You need to think
this through in...

141
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,588
"Jamaica's largest
freshwater pool!"

142
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,882
What are you
talking about?

143
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,220
I got us tickets
to Sandals, Jamaica.

144
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,346
We leave day after tomorrow.

145
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,930
You had better find the
skimpiest bikini there is.

146
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,477
Michael...

147
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:36,728
And it's all-inclusive.

148
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:37,938
Michael...

149
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,106
Yes.

150
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:40,565
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,652
No... Carole?

152
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,195
You walk out that
door and it is over.

153
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,572
I know.

154
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,373
Jim?

155
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,215
Hey.

156
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,719
I need to give you your
Christmas gift now, because...

157
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,054
Well, I'll just tell you.

158
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,264
What?

159
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,974
For the past few months,

160
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:17,186
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

161
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,024
Are you serious?

162
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,235
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

163
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,486
There's his application.

164
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,990
Oh, and this is where
I made him list every secret

165
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,492
he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

166
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,912
"Last year, my boss,
Michael Scott, took a day off

167
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:37,080
"because he said
he had pneumonia,

168
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:41,585
"but, really, he was leaving
early to go to magic camp." Wow.

169
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,920
So, here's the gift.

170
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,797
You get to decide what
his top-secret mission is.

171
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,008
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

172
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,722
You know what?

173
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,725
I really don't
think I should be

174
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,726
doing this stuff
anymore, though.

175
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,562
No, just because
of the promotion.

176
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh, yeah.

177
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,022
Just feels
a little bit like...

178
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,985
No, I get it.
Of course. Okay.

179
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,416
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

180
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,085
And if I fall back into the
same kind of things I used to do,

181
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,130
then what am I doing?

182
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,471
I'd like
everybody's attention.

183
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,723
Christmas is canceled.

184
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,433
You can't cancel a holiday.

185
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,435
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you'll lose New Year's.

186
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,520
What does that mean?

187
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:43,479
Jim, take New Year's
away from Stanley.

188
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:45,607
Michael, what's going on?

189
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,865
Carole and I split up.

190
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,993
Amicably.

191
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:58,119
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

192
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,121
to celebrate under
the circumstances.

193
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,998
Will they still air Rudolph?

194
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,917
That's not fair!

195
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,919
Are we going to
cancel Hanukkah as well?

196
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,758
Fine! Have your party.
Just no guests.

197
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,010
But we invited guests.

198
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,261
Well, you know what, Phyllis?

199
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,599
All of your guests
would have probably canceled

200
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,060
at the last minute anyway,

201
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,022
leaving your life a stupid,
rotten mess.

202
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,025
So. Okay.

203
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,700
It hurts.

204
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:39,244
I know.

205
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,788
It hurts my heart.

206
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,583
It hurts my stomach.

207
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,586
It hurts my arms.

208
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,630
Okay, well,
why are you laying like that?

209
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,048
Thanks.

210
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,927
How did you push
away the bad thoughts?

211
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,344
Like what?

212
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,098
Like maybe,
the real reason they left

213
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,644
was because
there were things

214
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:08,106
they wanted you to
do in bed that were...

215
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,274
What...

216
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,567
...foreign and scary?

217
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:11,901
I...

218
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,194
I don't really...

219
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,529
And not that you
didn't want to try them.

220
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,823
Some wine
might have helped.

221
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,367
Do you know what
I'm referring to?

222
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,118
I don't
need to know.

223
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,369
Michael?
Yeah?

224
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,163
Sorry to interrupt.

225
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,039
It appears we're
one bathrobe short.

226
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,709
Take it from Toby.
Copy.

227
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,671
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

228
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,506
It's all... Okay.
No, thank you.

229
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:39,137
Hey, Dwight.
Pretty nice robes. I...

230
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,765
Why?

231
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,852
Phyllis, I need you to pick
up green streamers at lunch.

232
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,855
I thought you said
green was whorish.

233
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,274
No. Orange is whorish.

234
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:55,862
So, I had
a couple of ideas

235
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,407
to make the Stamford
people feel more at home.

236
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,660
Each year we have
a Christmas raffle...

237
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,828
Okay.
It would never work here.

238
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:05,538
Okay.

239
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:08,208
Another idea was karaoke.

240
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,252
No.

241
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:11,336
A Christmas drinking game.

242
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,462
Yes!

243
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,964
God help you.

244
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,216
What?

245
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,301
These are all
terrible ideas.

246
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:22,138
And none of them are on the
theme of a Nutcracker Christmas.

247
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,641
I think you should leave.

248
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:26,601
You're kidding.

249
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,354
You tried this out,
and it's clearly not for you.

250
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,856
It's time to go.

251
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,154
Come on. Please? Thank you.

252
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,992
Okay. Thank you very much.

253
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,913
You
touched my heart you touched my soul

254
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,207
You changed my
life and all my goals

255
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:51,667
I know you well
I know your smell

256
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:53,837
What are you doing?

257
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,299
We're getting rid of everything
that reminds you of Carole.

258
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:59,675
Hey, what's the haps?

259
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,886
Carole?

260
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,931
Oh, look at this.

261
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,184
Your old condo
closing papers.

262
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,353
It's riddled
with Carole's name.

263
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,855
I wish I could
throw this in the box.

264
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:15,191
You have been
the one for me

265
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,157
Why don't you just
buy the whole song?

266
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,203
I don't have to buy it.

267
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,747
I just want to taste it.

268
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:32,458
I just want... I just
want a little taste of it.

269
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,047
Look at this,
she saved you $2,000

270
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,049
because they failed to
report a mold problem.

271
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,094
But wouldn't that
affect the final...

272
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,679
How did she...

273
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,975
Oh, I see what she did.
That is good.

274
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,270
Wow. That Carole
is one smart cookie.

275
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,233
Goodbye my lover,
goodbye my friend

276
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,525
You have been the one

277
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,904
You have been the one for me

278
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:08,619
You touched my heart,
you touched my soul...

279
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,663
This is an old adage.

280
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,292
But they say that
when you find true love,

281
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,004
you know within
the first 24 hours.

282
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,338
With Carole,

283
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:24,886
I knew within the first 24 minutes
of the second day I met her.

284
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,233
I feel like I've been
kind of cold to Karen.

285
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,193
And there's no
real reason for it.

286
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,655
I mean, it's not like she's
ever done anything to me.

287
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,491
So, I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

288
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,827
Hey, Karen, sorry
about that meeting today.

289
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:52,288
That was really crazy.

290
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,374
Yeah, right?
I'm so glad you said that.

291
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,877
Because I don't know how
those meetings usually go.

292
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,004
Usually like that.

293
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,005
Does anyone ever
stand up to Angela? Or...

294
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,091
I think one of
her cats did once.

295
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,092
She came in with
scratches all over her face.

296
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,386
Right.

297
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:09,764
I really liked
your karaoke idea.

298
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,057
Oh, cool, yeah.

299
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,267
That could really be fun.

300
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,643
You guys do a raffle?
Thank you.

301
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,769
Yeah, we do a raffle.

302
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,359
Hey, Kev.
Hey.

303
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:36,624
This should have
been up yesterday.

304
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,418
It'll be all right.

305
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,213
What is that?

306
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,591
"The Committee to
Plan Parties invites you

307
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,217
"to a Margarita
-Karaoke-Christmas"?

308
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:48,469
There's no such thing as
the Committee to Plan Parties!

309
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,971
There is now.
We just started it.

310
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,182
Well, you can't
just start a committee.

311
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:53,266
You have to have funding.

312
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,392
What's your funding?

313
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:55,644
Two hundred dollars.

314
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:56,936
What's ours again?

315
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,813
Two hundred and one dollars.
Right.

316
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,690
Hey, a margarita-karaoke-
Christmas party.

317
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,692
That sounds like fun.

318
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,277
No. That is not a party.

319
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,779
There is only one party,
and it's hosted

320
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,322
by the Party
Planning Committee,

321
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,740
and it starts at 3:00.

322
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,659
Then why are
there two flyers?

323
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:14,245
I understand that this is confusing
for everyone. Let me explain.

324
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,371
There's a party
that starts at 3:00...

325
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,623
Right.

326
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,084
...and then there's a way more
fun party that starts at 2:45.

327
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:22,920
Right, and if you're interested
in the way-more-fun party,

328
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,964
all the info
can be found here,

329
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,008
on our more
brightly colored flyer.

330
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,348
I didn't see where it was.

331
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,978
Yep, looks like the Scranton
people and the Stamford people

332
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,189
are finally coming together.

333
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,191
And that's what
you want, right?

334
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,903
I think that's really...

335
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,112
Pam and Karen,

336
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:50,156
I am ordering you
to cease and desist

337
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,242
all party
planning immediately.

338
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,367
You can't do that.

339
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,787
As ranking number three
in this office, I am order...

340
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,581
I'm number three.
You're number four.

341
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,248
Yeah, but I'm number three.
No.

342
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:01,459
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

343
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,127
and party
paraphernalia immediately.

344
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,712
They will be returned
to you on January 4.

345
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:05,839
Okay,
I think I can help here.

346
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:06,965
Okay, good.

347
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:08,132
As ranking number two,

348
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,675
I am starting
a committee to determine

349
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,261
the validity of
the two committees,

350
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,720
and I am the sole member.

351
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:13,805
The committee
will act on this now.

352
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,931
Okay, this is stupid.

353
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,099
Could you
please keep it down?

354
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,350
I'm in session.

355
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,646
I have determined
that this committee is valid.

356
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,815
Yeah! What? No! No!
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

357
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,735
Permission to join
the Validity Committee.

358
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,071
Permission denied.

359
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,198
Damn it.

360
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,455
Hey. I can't concentrate when
I know you're in pain, man.

361
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,540
Let me take you to lunch.

362
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,377
Come on! My treat.

363
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,171
All right.

364
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:47,672
Nothing here to
distract myself with anyway.

365
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,299
That's my boy.

366
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:51,008
I know
the perfect place, too.

367
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,468
Hooters?

368
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,638
No. Benihana.
Much classier.

369
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:59,517
But don't worry, the
babes are totally hot, too.

370
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,397
I need my entourage.

371
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,982
Jim! Dwight! Ryan. Come on.

372
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,317
We're going to Asian Hooters.

373
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,443
Oh, man, I can't.
Why not?

374
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
I'm not feeling so well.

375
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:11,737
I got a ton of
work to do here.

376
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,531
MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

377
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,367
I just ate there last night.

378
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,078
All right. Feel better.
Thanks.

379
00:17:18,161 --> 00:17:19,203
Come on, Jim, let's go.

380
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,413
Okay.

381
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,958
Wow! Thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

382
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,835
Doctor appointment.
Car trouble. Planter warts.

383
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,128
Grandad fought
in World War ll.

384
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,172
Use your head, man.
I keep mine in here.

385
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,341
Look alive, Halpert.
Welcome back.

386
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,468
Bros before hos. Why?

387
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,762
Because your bros are
always there for you.

388
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,013
They have got your back

389
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,183
after your ho rips your
heart out for no good reason.

390
00:17:41,893 --> 00:17:44,604
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

391
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,107
and you told her that she
was the only ho for you,

392
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,068
and that she was better than
all the other hos in the world.

393
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,528
And then...

394
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,785
Then suddenly she's
not your ho no mo'!

395
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:09,044
So she looks
really hot, so I said,

396
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,090
"You look hotter than
usual today." Thank you.

397
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:14,133
Michael?

398
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:17,178
Head of the table.
May 1?

399
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,767
Actually, sir,

400
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,893
I'm going to need to
take this chair, so...

401
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,103
Dwight, just leave him.

402
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:27,188
Leave them alone, please.

403
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,357
They are on a date.
They look very happy.

404
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,361
So she looks at me,
right, and she goes,

405
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:35,696
“I'm sorry.
Do I even know you?"

406
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:38,282
After a year!

407
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:39,575
A year of buying
lattes from her.

408
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,910
Do you believe that?

409
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,036
Yes.

410
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,455
I can't hear
what you're saying.

411
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:45,581
Carole used to drink lattes.

412
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,749
Who're you talking about?

413
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,544
She would get this
little foam mustache...

414
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,754
Carole had a mustache?

415
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:52,839
...and I used to say,
"Hey, got latte?"

416
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,091
And she'd say,
"That's not funny."

417
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,843
What are you
guys talking about?

418
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,678
She totally got me.
She understood

419
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,931
that we didn't have
to laugh... Michael?

420
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,391
...to enjoy each other.
Michael.

421
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,517
What?

422
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,644
Repeat what you said louder!

423
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,229
It is my job to be
there for Michael.

424
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,731
How can I be
there for Michael

425
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,774
if I'm here for Michael?

426
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,239
I'm already starting to forget
what color eyes she had.

427
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,367
I can't...
Okay, I'm gonna call her.

428
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,744
I am going to call
and find out... No!

429
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:24,829
Who are you calling?

430
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,997
Put it away.
Put that away.

431
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,164
I'm going to call her.

432
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:30,000
SOS! We...
Hi. Mayday!

433
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,587
Man down over here.
We need your help.

434
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,422
What can I get for you?

435
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,510
I think we'll start
with a round of Nagasakis.

436
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,347
One part eggnog,
three parts sake.

437
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,352
Some places won't make it for you,
though, because eggnog is seasonal.

438
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,064
You should put out
salt for the rims.

439
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,567
That's a great idea.

440
00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:56,568
Phyllis?

441
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
I was just getting a snack.

442
00:19:58,446 --> 00:19:59,989
You can have
your snack in here.

443
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,492
Pam, don't tell her
what to do. Phyllis?

444
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,577
Okay.

445
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,834
I think I'll go
to Angela's party,

446
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,920
because that's
the party I know.

447
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:18,340
I miss the days when there was
only one party I didn't want to go to.

448
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,802
So, I only use three?

449
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,722
If you're using more than three
pieces of tape to wrap a present,

450
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,848
you're doing it wrong.

451
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,351
Okay. And where'd you get
all those cool bows?

452
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,978
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

453
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:33,189
Okay.

454
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,067
Are you sure I
can't use, like,

455
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,526
the cartoons
from the newspaper?

456
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,528
Oh, yeah,
your mom will love that.

457
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,740
Hey.

458
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,118
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

459
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,243
Bye.

460
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,206
He's cute.
You should date him.

461
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,959
Yeah, maybe.

462
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,966
Looks like you got a little
Nakiri knife action going there.

463
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,634
No, is Usuba.

464
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,679
Yeah, I bet you wish you had
a Nakiri, though.

465
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,640
Actually,
the Usuba is the better knife

466
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,642
when you working
with this quantity.

467
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,937
I don't know.
Still think Nakiri's better.

468
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,023
I think he'd know.

469
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,195
Nothing he's doing
is cheering me up.

470
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:23,864
Wait for the onion.
Trust me.

471
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,828
Hey, Cindy,

472
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,163
he just had his heart broken.

473
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,580
You wouldn't do
that to him, would you?

474
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,165
I don't know.

475
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:34,792
Sure you would!
Look at you.

476
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,544
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,048
You made her laugh! Yes!

478
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,342
She totally digs us.

479
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,219
Watch. Watch. Watch.

480
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,100
What did I tell you?

481
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,060
You're right. That's good.

482
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,400
Hello, everyone.

483
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,193
We would just
like to announce that

484
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,987
our party is starting
now in the break room.

485
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,113
So...

486
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,697
I have a very important announcement
to make about your paychecks.

487
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:15,499
Your paychecks will be
arriving, as scheduled, on Friday.

488
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:20,296
And they will be in the correct
amount that they normally are in.

489
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,635
Please stand by for a very
important announcement

490
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,805
further
regarding your paycheck!

491
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,017
I need to know if I
can start the party.

492
00:22:35,186 --> 00:22:36,312
Michael.

493
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,647
Hey!

494
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,732
Over here! Michael!

495
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,567
It's...

496
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:45,154
I don't know.
No one can hear me.

497
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:47,030
You know what?
Start the party.

498
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,367
Did Michael give you
permission to do this?

499
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,828
Start the party.

500
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,500
Also, I would like
to inform you

501
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,713
that, as a special treat, my
party will be starting early.

502
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,840
In fact, it will be
starting right now.

503
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:07,217
Our party is also
starting now. Yeah.

504
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:35,329
All right, Stanley!
Good choice!

505
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,793
Welcome, Hannah!

506
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,587
You will not be disappointed!

507
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,171
Why would I be disappointed?

508
00:23:44,255 --> 00:23:45,839
I said you
wouldn't be disappointed.

509
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:53,555
Meredith, if you don't come to my
party, you will be very, very sorry.

510
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,267
That a threat?

511
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,310
No, it's an invitation.

512
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,479
We have vodka!

513
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,646
Lots of it.

514
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,572
I hear Angela's party will
have double-fudge brownies.

515
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,866
It will also have Angela.

516
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,911
So double-fudge, Angela.

517
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,747
Double-fudge,

518
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,667
Angela.

519
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:31,218
Brownies. Cupcakes.

520
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,887
Don't push it.

521
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,607
Are we taking this
too far?

522
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,902
You know what, I don't think
we're taking this far enough.

523
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,279
What?

524
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:52,448
I got goosebumps.

525
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,826
I don't back down.

526
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,995
My sister and I used
to be best friends,

527
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,248
and we haven't
talked in 16 years

528
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:03,167
over some disagreement
I don't even remember.

529
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,377
So...

530
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:07,046
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

531
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,799
Mmm.

532
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,260
Damn, this chicken is good!

533
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,347
My compliments to the chef,
which is you!

534
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,265
Right?

535
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,936
Awesome! I need some meat.

536
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:24,063
I want some steak.

537
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,943
That guy's got steak.
I see steak!

538
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,236
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

539
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,904
En garde!

540
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,907
It's family style.

541
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:36,408
No. It's not.

542
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:38,827
Cindy! Cindy.

543
00:25:38,911 --> 00:25:41,413
I love steak. I love it!

544
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:47,207
I want you to close your eyes
and imagine your dream house.

545
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,299
Come on!
Do it for Michael.

546
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,134
He's had a really
long day.

547
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,344
What're you doing?

548
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,804
This is great.

549
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,723
Jim! Jim!
Okay...

550
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,224
Cindy, you are so...

551
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,559
What...

552
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:03,769
What's happening?

553
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:07,106
She's asleep.

554
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,485
Narcolepsy.
Probably.

555
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,405
Okay. Now, open your eyes
and describe it to me.

556
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,158
I don't know.

557
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,994
It has four
bedrooms and a loft.

558
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,121
Oh, my God! Now she's up.
Yeah.

559
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,583
And she's trying to describe
how to correctly butcher a goose.

560
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,209
But she's having
trouble coming up with it.

561
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:30,212
Okay. Cindy! Yo!
Cindy! Cindy!

562
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:34,049
Hold its neck back, insert
the knife beneath the jaw,

563
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,551
bring it all the way around.

564
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,052
There's gonna be
a good amount of blood.

565
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,763
But don't let
that bother you.

566
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:40,889
Have a bucket
there for the blood,

567
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,100
and the innards,
and the feathers.

568
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,436
Oh, no, this is different.

569
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,897
The CIA thing,
that was a prank on Dwight.

570
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,858
This is more like a...

571
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:54,069
Okay. It's pretty
much the same thing.

572
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:10,753
What do you think?

573
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,004
Fruity, and delicious.

574
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,090
See, I told you.
You want one, Meredith?

575
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,258
No, thanks.
They're too sweet.

576
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,261
Hey, so, what's the status?

577
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:20,929
It looks like they
forgot the power cord.

578
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,472
What?
Oh, you're kidding me!

579
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,225
No.
Oh, God.

580
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,268
You guys... Guys?

581
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:28,729
I'm sorry, but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

582
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,023
What?
Well, that blows!

583
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,149
Hang on, little ladies.

584
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,484
You don't need this thing.

585
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:34,860
I'll go grab my synthesizer.

586
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,986
All right!

587
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,154
Yeah, Darryl!

588
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,949
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

589
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,496
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

590
00:27:46,205 --> 00:27:47,456
Hey.

591
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,127
Hey, look, when you get
done with your meeting,

592
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,252
you should come
to the break room.

593
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:53,379
We having a party.

594
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:54,671
Oh, okay.

595
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,048
All right. See y'all.

596
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,306
These nuts are
really hard to crack.

597
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,808
Try harder, then.

598
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,982
No one has seconds
until everyone's had some.

599
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:15,901
You've got to be kidding!

600
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,736
You've got
to be kidding!

601
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:26,870
Cold, huh?

602
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:30,332
That'll help.

603
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,712
Is it cold in there?

604
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,714
They have been
checking us out all night!

605
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,050
I'm not kidding!

606
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,343
You know what we should do?
What?

607
00:28:41,427 --> 00:28:43,595
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

608
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,640
Now you are
thinking! Yes!

609
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,766
And you know what?

610
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:52,517
Because you've had such
a rough day, you get Cindy.

611
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,066
You are such a mensch,
my friend.

612
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,572
Okay! Where is everybody?

613
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,993
I would like them to
meet my new girlfriend.

614
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,245
I'm sure they'll
want to meet her, too.

615
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:16,499
The least I could do was
give some poor sick kid a bike.

616
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,089
That rocks.

617
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,549
No, you rock.

618
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,342
Tell you what,
if you want it, it's yours.

619
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,970
Thanks!

620
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,181
I wanna give you something.

621
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,267
Oh!

622
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:33,395
That's what she said.

623
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:39,151
Hello! I would like everybody
to meet my new girlfriend.

624
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,320
And my new girlfriend.

625
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:42,529
Where's Dwight?

626
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,281
Is he the hot one
or the giant baby?

627
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,075
The giant baby.

628
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:48,243
Wow. I am so sorry.

629
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,454
I had no idea this
party'd be so lame.

630
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,289
There's another
party in the break room.

631
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,707
Oh, party in the break room!
Let's go!

632
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:55,208
Let's go. Thank God.

633
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,295
- Let's go to the break room!
- Excuse me!

634
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,879
Waitress lady! Hey!

635
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,506
Where do you think
you're going with that?

636
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:01,715
I thought I could have it.

637
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,967
No, you can't have it!

638
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,844
I don't walk into your house and
steal your Hello Kitty backpack!

639
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,512
Shut it!

640
00:30:07,596 --> 00:30:08,847
Come on. Party.

641
00:30:08,931 --> 00:30:11,016
Hey! It's Angela!

642
00:30:11,892 --> 00:30:12,893
Hey...

643
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:14,936
We're going to the...

644
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:19,316
I want you to know

645
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,112
That I'm happy for you

646
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:27,241
I wish nothing but...

647
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:32,158
I just think that there are two
specific kinds of people in the world.

648
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:37,497
People who own houses,
and people who own condos.

649
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:44,671
And my question to
you is, do you agree?

650
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,095
Do I agree about what?

651
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:50,222
"Do you agree about what?"

652
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,895
Wow! You're lucky
you're so darn cute.

653
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:58,355
What're you
talking about?

654
00:30:58,522 --> 00:30:59,606
What are you talking about?

655
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,860
And I'm here to remind you

656
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:07,781
Of the mess you
left when you went away

657
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:11,702
It's not fair to deny me

658
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:15,122
Of the cross I bear
that you gave to me

659
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:19,706
You, you, you, you, you,
you, you Oughta know!

660
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,504
Nice. Way to go, Kev!

661
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:23,797
Good work!
Yeah!

662
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,809
Did you have
fun at Benihana's?

663
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,144
No!

664
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:40,438
It was awful.
I couldn't hear anything.

665
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:45,360
I've had
the worst day here.

666
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:56,371
Dwight, you won the raffle.

667
00:31:56,455 --> 00:31:59,749
No way! Yeah!

668
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,043
Open it. Open it.

669
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,714
Do you like it?

670
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,007
Walkie-talkies.

671
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,509
Can I talk to you for a
second? - Yes!

672
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,180
Well, the Committee to Plan
Parties has served its purpose.

673
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:16,224
We're gonna disband
in the name of Christmas.

674
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,104
In the name of
Nutcracker Christmas.

675
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:24,774
Angela?

676
00:32:25,025 --> 00:32:28,653
We've been hearing really
great things about your brownies,

677
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,698
and we were hoping you'd
consider merging the two parties.

678
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,326
I'm not sure.

679
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,040
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

680
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,085
Yeah, but we don't
have a power cord.

681
00:32:44,336 --> 00:32:46,504
I may have seen it somewhere.

682
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:54,012
Is it this one?

683
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,140
Yeah, thanks.

684
00:32:58,517 --> 00:32:59,935
We'll go tell everyone.

685
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,061
Okay.
Okay.

686
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,400
And if you want love

687
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,694
We'll make it

688
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:11,738
Swim in a big sea

689
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:13,949
of blankets

690
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:17,076
Take all your big plans

691
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,455
And break 'em

692
00:33:19,538 --> 00:33:23,208
This is bound to take a while

693
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:27,254
your body is a wonderland

694
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:31,633
Your body is a wonderland

695
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,802
Your hands

696
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,222
Your body is a wonderland

697
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,016
I'll use my hands on it

698
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,314
Something 'bout the way
your hair falls in your face

699
00:33:45,564 --> 00:33:48,191
Whatever we deny or embrace

700
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,944
For worse or for better

701
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,282
We belong, we belong

702
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,160
We belong together, Ryan

703
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,288
When you know, you just know.

704
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,915
Right?

705
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,750
Right.
Check her out.

706
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,376
Which one?

707
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:07,961
My little gal over there?
Babelectable.

708
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,254
Which one is she?

709
00:34:12,174 --> 00:34:14,634
It's the...
It's one of those two.

710
00:34:15,844 --> 00:34:17,095
You don't know?

711
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,513
Dude, you should know.

712
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:23,018
Yeah, well, it's been hard. They're
wearing the exact same uniform,

713
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,103
and I've been drinking,

714
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:29,687
and, you know how all
waitresses look alike.

715
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,363
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

716
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,198
Stevie Wonder is married.

717
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,326
Are you going to tell me

718
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,204
that Stevie Wonder
doesn't love his wife

719
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,415
just because he's not sure
what she looks like?

720
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,041
Hey!

721
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,376
Where's my girl?

722
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:52,464
Is she in the fridge?

723
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,675
Where is she hiding?

724
00:34:55,342 --> 00:34:57,510
I don't know where she is!

725
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,349
'Cause I'm drunk.
I can't even find her.

726
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,185
You know where I am.

727
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,394
I do!

728
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:09,772
Hi! I just haven't
hugged you in a while.

729
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:16,029
Good. That felt good.
Let's go. Party!

730
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,033
Spinning and
reeling with love

731
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:26,623
Given the time
I might come back down

732
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,044
But it feels so good

733
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:33,463
My feet don't
touch the ground

734
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,097
Well, everybody knows
I'm crazy about you

735
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,184
Monkey, this is possum.
Do you copy?

736
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,436
Copy, possum.
What's your 20?

737
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:50,355
No way.

738
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,066
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

739
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,943
And now we get to
remember it forever.

740
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,486
Thank you.
Thank you.

741
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:03,618
Hey!

742
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,786
Hey, you!

743
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,746
How are you?

744
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,791
This party blows,
SO we're gonna leave.

745
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,252
No, no, no.
Hey, you should stay,

746
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,671
because we are
having fun, and...

747
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:17,006
Cool.
Where do you wanna go?

748
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,842
We're just gonna take off.

749
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,138
You know what?
I... Okay, listen.

750
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,723
I like you.

751
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,391
I really like you.

752
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,520
So much, in fact, that I would
like you to accompany me

753
00:36:30,604 --> 00:36:32,897
on a trip to Sandals,
Jamaica.

754
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,277
Nah, I have school.

755
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:47,579
Can I help? Okay.

756
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:49,455
Merry Christmas!

757
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:50,790
Merry Christmas.

758
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:57,376
Lady,
from the moment I saw you

759
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:04,634
Standing all alone

760
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:12,308
You gave all
the love that I needed

761
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,235
That waitress was the one.

762
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,445
No, she wasn't.

763
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,489
How can you be sure?

764
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,033
Well, for starters,
I've known you as a couple

765
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,910
since the beginning
of the relationship,

766
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,829
which was approximately
three hours ago...

767
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:29,913
Don't make fun of me.

768
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:30,998
You're making fun of me.

769
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,292
Sorry.

770
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,300
I guess I didn't
know her very well.

771
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,596
I marked her arm.

772
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,890
You what?

773
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,645
I put a mark on her arm

774
00:37:57,649 --> 00:37:59,609
so I could tell them apart.

775
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:02,445
I don't... I know. I know.

776
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,909
I can't believe I
gave her my bike.

777
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,368
Yeah.

778
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:12,414
Why do I feel like crap?

779
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,126
You just had a rebound.

780
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,297
I had a rebound.

781
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,589
Yeah.

782
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:25,927
Which, don't get me wrong,
can be a really fun distraction.

783
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,596
But, when it's over,

784
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,100
you're left thinking about
the girl you really like,

785
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,478
the one that
broke your heart.

786
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:41,192
I totally rebounded.

787
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,780
Someone else shoots, and
I take the ball and I score.

788
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,364
Well, I guess I
didn't really score,

789
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:50,034
and I'm not sure who is
actually shooting, but...

790
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,786
Whatever!

791
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,289
Doesn't matter.
It's all good.

792
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,875
Or, as my ex might say,

793
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,459
"Domo arigato, Mr. Scotto!"

794
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:07,673
Little baby

That's fit to give a king
Pa rum pum pum pum...

798
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,953
Yeah. Yes,
I just wanted to see

799
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,374
if you would like to
come to Jamaica with me.

800
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:40,460
There's this
resort called Sandals.

801
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,549
Really?

802
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:49,177
Okay. All right.

803
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,930
I promise you
won't be disappointed.

804
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,848
It's all-inclusive.

805
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:58,227
Shall I play for you?
Pa rum pum pum pum

806
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,273
Too soon.

807
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:05,856
I played my drum for Him

811
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,172
Night, Pam.

812
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,256
Night.

813
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,260
Oh, you know what?

814
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:34,264
Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I
intercepted a transmission earlier,

815
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,516
and it seems that the CIA
is gonna need Dwight

816
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,352
down in their headquarters
at Langley for training

817
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:42,522
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

818
00:40:44,524 --> 00:40:47,360
We should get him a bus
ticket to make his trip easier.

819
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,571
Oh, no, that
would be great. We should try.

820
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,158
It costs $75.

821
00:40:55,702 --> 00:40:58,621
Well, maybe the CIA
could send a helicopter.

822
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,513
"You have been compromised.
Abort mission. Destroy phone."

823
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,099
"Destroy phone."
