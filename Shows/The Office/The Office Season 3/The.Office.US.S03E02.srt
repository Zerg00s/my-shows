1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:05,630
Pam?
Yeah?

2
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,716
Did you see Oprah yesterday?
No, I didn't.

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:12,637
I... I'm going to be a father.

4
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,518
What was Oprah about?
Angelina Jolie was on.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,480
And she adopted a baby from Asia,
and she said that it changed her life,

6
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:24,774
and that really inspired me.

7
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:30,947
So I want you to look into see how
much a little Chinese baby would cost.

8
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,284
That's a really big decision.
I know.

9
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:37,912
Maybe you should wait
before you adopt.

10
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:39,789
Well...
Or not adopt.

11
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,707
Just do it, okay?

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,003
Roy's sister looked into it and
the application alone costs $1,000.

13
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,716
Well, find out

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,388
if there's a cheaper, less
expensive baby out there, okay?

15
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,057
You know, she also said the
waiting list is, like, eight months.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,267
Eight months?
Yeah.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,227
I don't even know if I want
a baby in eight months.

18
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,853
Probably won't.

19
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:06,691
You know what, Pam?

20
00:01:06,774 --> 00:01:08,526
If in 10 years,

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,488
I haven't had a baby
and you haven't had a baby...

22
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,739
No, Michael.

23
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,659
Twenty years.
No, Michael.

24
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:19,036
Thirty.

25
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,039
Sure.

26
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,125
It's a deal.

27
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,868
All right,
three pairs of pants.

28
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,494
Three pairs of socks.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,497
Three packs of condoms.
Yes.

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,792
Fun jeans.
Right there.

31
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:11,589
Sign.
Per diem.

32
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,051
Guess where I
am going? I will give you a hint.

33
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,846
It is a booze-fuelled sex romp
where anything goes.

34
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,598
You are correct, sir!

35
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,849
I am headed to Philadelphia

36
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:25,895
for the annual Northeastern
Mid-Market Office Supply Convention.

37
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:29,565
And Jim Halpert is going
to be coming, which'll be fun.

38
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:34,028
Poor little guy has been stuck
working under Josh,

39
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,741
the poor man's Michael Scott,
as he is known around my condo.

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,745
Don't be mad,
it is a business trip.

41
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,831
But I don't understand.
It's for managers.

42
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,709
Monkey, I am an ARM,
Assistant Regional Manager.

43
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,670
I know! It's...

44
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,174
I was just really hoping we
could spend some time together.

45
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,971
Are you still there?
Yes, monkey.

46
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,600
Don't "monkey" me! You can't
wait to get out of here, ARM!

47
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,437
In the Martin family,
we like to say,

48
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,565
"Looks like someone took
the slow train from Philly."

49
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,276
That's code for
"Check out the slut."

50
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,737
What is...

51
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,657
Why are there flies in here?

52
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:22,284
Oh, my God! Are you
so excited for tonight?

53
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,704
I'm so excited. You guys
are gonna click, I can feel it.

54
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,706
So what are you wearing?

55
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,957
This.

56
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,962
You look so pretty.

57
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,756
Thank you.

58
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,551
Yes, I have a date.

59
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,554
He's a cartoonist
for the local paper,

60
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:44,890
which is really neat,
because I like to draw, too.

61
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,768
I'm kind of nervous.

62
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,772
I haven't been on a
first date in nine years.

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,985
Probably shouldn't
broadcast that.

64
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,196
Well, remember, no matter
how much you may want to,

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,199
do not sleep with him on the
first date, it gives him all the power.

66
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,536
Sleep with who?
Whom? Whom? Whom?

67
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:08,038
My neighbor, Alan. They're
going on a date tonight.

68
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:11,041
Oh, wow! Oh, my God,
I have a great idea.

69
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,170
You know what you should do? Be
hilarious. Wear your wedding dress.

70
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,840
It'd be a great icebreaker!
And your veil.

71
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,925
Yeah. Do it!

72
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,303
I'll probably just wear this.
Really?

73
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:24,346
Okay, well, word of advice,

74
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,266
unbutton that top button,
let those things breathe.

75
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,852
Any message you want me
to relate to Jim?

76
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:31,979
"Um," okay. Um...

77
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,190
You got that?
I got it.

78
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,983
Write it down.
I'll write it down.

79
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,486
Um, um, um, um...

80
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,117
There's my girl.

81
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,579
Noticed you handing out
some shekels.

82
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,539
How would one get
on that train?

83
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,708
That was per diem
for Philadelphia.

84
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,585
That town smells
like cheese steaks.

85
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,921
That town is full of history!

86
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,802
Andrea's the office bitch.

87
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,179
You'll get used to her.

88
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,433
Creed.

89
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,940
Can I have
my neck pillow back?

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,650
Michael!

91
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,945
Can I have
my neck pillow back?

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,200
Hey, Michael. MICHAEL:
Hey, Josh, how you doing?

93
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:27,701
Pretty good, how you doing?
Good to see you.

94
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,871
There he is! There's
the traitor. Traitor! Traitor!

95
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,957
Come here, you. Come here!

96
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,628
The... The progidal...

97
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,296
My son returns!

98
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,050
I was shocked when he told me
he was transferring to Stamford.

99
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,136
It's like with firemen, you
don't leave your brothers behind.

100
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
Even if you find out

101
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,725
that there is a better fire
in Connecticut.

102
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:55,437
It's really good to
see you, man. Yeah.

103
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,774
Wow. I didn't expect that.

104
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,318
It's good to see you, too.

105
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:06,282
Oh, hey, how's it going up there?
Have you made any sales yet?

106
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,033
Yeah, sold about 40,000.

107
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,785
Hey!
Shut up, that's impossible.

108
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,289
No, it's not, and I did, yeah.
Well, I did it, too.

109
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,166
You know, when I saw Dwight,

110
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,961
I realized
how stupid and petty

111
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:20,629
all those pranks
I pulled on him were.

112
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,924
And then he spoke.

113
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,928
I wonder how hard it would be
to get a copy of his room key.

114
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,180
So did you hear?
What?

115
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,891
Pam's back
on the market again.

116
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,350
Really? She's dating?

117
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:37,229
If I weren't engaged,
I would so hit that.

118
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,861
So what kind of commissions
you get up there?

119
00:06:43,944 --> 00:06:46,906
Oh, Dwight,
I missed you so much.

120
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,450
You're so immature.

121
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,245
Listen, Michael, I heard
you were a great salesman,

122
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,622
and I just wanted
to let you know

123
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,290
that if our branch
absorbs your branch,

124
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:58,375
I'm gonna look for a
place for you in Stamford.

125
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,501
Oh, hey!

126
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,586
- Hey.
- Hey, Jan.

127
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,004
We all checked in?
Yes.

128
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:04,840
Great. Let's dump our stuff and
meet back down here in half an hour.

129
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,258
- Okay.
- Okay.

130
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,468
Jan?

131
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,096
Look, I think we need to set
some ground rules.

132
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,100
What are you talking about? The
800-pound gorilla in the room. Carole?

133
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,310
I'm still dating her,

134
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,272
so nothing can happen
between us at the convention.

135
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,024
Step away from me, Michael.

136
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:25,152
Thank you for being so brave
with all of this.

137
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,071
Thank you.

138
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:36,288
Alan's cartoon's
so funny, right?

139
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,457
And they're, like, so smart.

140
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,251
I don't even know what
they mean half the time.

141
00:07:56,183 --> 00:07:59,478
This party is gonna
be awesome! I know!

142
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:04,024
That is specifically why I chose
a room close to the elevator.

143
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,568
More foot traffic.
Check it out.

144
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:09,488
That is crooked. On that side.

145
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:10,698
Wow.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,033
Hey, hey!

147
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,452
- That is a lot of liquor.
- Yeah.

148
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,829
And a dartboard.

149
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,540
Well, that's how we do it in
Scranton, or did you forget?

150
00:08:19,623 --> 00:08:21,625
Ain't no party like
a Scranton party

151
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,544
'cause a Scranton party
don't stop!

152
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,466
We should probably head on
down, you know, hook up with Jan.

153
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,428
Hey, well, we have time!
One for the road, gentlemen?

154
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,139
"A shot of Midori, perhaps?"

155
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,603
Oh, no, sorry,
it's an inside joke.

156
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,064
There's this bartender
in Stamford who...

157
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,692
You know what?
You just had to be there.

158
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,570
I wish I was!
I love inside jokes.

159
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,614
Love to be
a part of one someday.

160
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,621
We should...
Yeah!

161
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,249
All right, see you guys down
there. See you guys. All right.

162
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:03,917
Change your mind,
come back up.

163
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,502
I'll do a shot
with you, Michael.

164
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,297
Don't be gross.
It's not even lunch yet.

165
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:13,844
Swag!

166
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,472
Stuff we all get.

167
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:20,851
I basically decorated my condo
for free with all of my swag!

168
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:23,562
Check it out!
Oh, my God.

169
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,731
Hi! I'm Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin.

170
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,691
Dwight Schrute, Assistant
Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin.

171
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,027
All right.
I'm a huge fan.

172
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,612
Thanks, appreciate it, guys.
You know what?

173
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,490
I'm having a big blowout tonight,
Room 308, hope you can come.

174
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,034
All right, maybe. If I can.
Well, cool!

175
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:40,037
Okay, so can I tell people
you're gonna be there?

176
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,915
No, you cannot.
So maybe. See you.

177
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,710
Why do they call him "The
Bus"? Because he's afraid to fly.

178
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,128
Smile!

179
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,506
Do you remember me
from last year?

180
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,591
There's a party
in my room, 308.

181
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,051
Can't miss it,
right off the elevator.

182
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,594
Tonight! Be there!

183
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,554
All right,
Jan just e-mailed me.

184
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,014
She wants us to
meet her up front.

185
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,684
Yup! Yeah, she's up front. You
don't have e-mail on your phone.

186
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,354
I don't have to, I just know.

187
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,648
Yes? Hello?

188
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,400
No one just called you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

189
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,485
Take care.
Nice to meet you.

190
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,569
I'll see you soon.
Yeah, stop by.

191
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,780
Take care.
See you in a bit. Bye-bye.

192
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:17,616
May I have
a moment of your time, please?

193
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,702
I need you to do something
for me. Yes, anything.

194
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,704
I want you to
dig up some dirt on Josh,

195
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,581
find out if there are
any skeletons in his attic.

196
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,917
I'll talk to my buddy down
at the station, stat.

197
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,253
Hey, Pam.

198
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,922
Hey, what's up?
It's... How are...

199
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,298
I might ask if you wanted...

200
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,551
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

201
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,804
He's not in the office.
Can I take a message?

202
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,598
I will.

203
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,475
You, too.

204
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,186
Sorry, what's up?

205
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,855
If...

206
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,530
I just completely forgot
what I was gonna say.

207
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,157
It's so weird.

208
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,367
Okay.

209
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,245
Well, if you think of it,
I'll be here.

210
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,538
Okay.

211
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:13,380
So I called my buddy down
at the station today

212
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,009
to have him run a background
check on Josh Porter,

213
00:11:17,092 --> 00:11:19,678
see if there's any known
aliases, etcetera.

214
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:23,182
And?
He wasn't volunteering today.

215
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:31,565
Yeah. Things have been
pretty crazy around the office.

216
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,567
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

217
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,111
We moved Ryan
over to your desk...

218
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:40,949
Tell him I say hi. I will call
him later with that message.

219
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,243
Hey, how's Toby?

220
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,415
Toby Flenderson is everything
that is wrong with the paper industry.

221
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,500
Is he why you left?

222
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,962
Oh, no, it was just, you know, a
good opportunity for me, a promotion.

223
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,340
I got a chance to... Opportunity,
promotion, blah, blah...

224
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:58,884
You know, Jim,
those are just words.

225
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:03,597
Have you taken into account
other factors, vis-a-vis bosses?

226
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,725
Is Josh funnier than I am?
Does he even have a girlfriend?

227
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,352
Because I have two, basically.

228
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:11,188
Michael, it's really
not a competition.

229
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,317
Jim got us a great lead with the
new rep from National Envelope.

230
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,486
Really? Great. We can
grab lunch with him tomorrow.

231
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,656
Hey, Jan? Jan? Don't
worry, I have got the tip.

232
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,492
Whoa, Michael!
Wow!

233
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,868
Oh, my God, thank you!
Hey, no problem.

234
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,705
Was that your per diem? No,
that was a different $100 bill.

235
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,249
What have you generated,
Michael?

236
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:34,169
I have generated a lot of
interest in my party this evening.

237
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,129
What party?

238
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,800
The party I'm having tonight in
308, obviously, you are invited.

239
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:45,764
Michael, Jim and Josh
are in meetings all day,

240
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:48,725
and I am in and out
of meetings.

241
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,646
I... I can't
stay on top of you 24/7.

242
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,071
You should order the most
expensive thing on the menu.

243
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,115
So he knows you're worth it.

244
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,451
If you do that,
you're gonna have to put out.

245
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,706
Oh, yeah,
you'll have to put out.

246
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,293
Is there a key for a Jane Doe?

247
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,587
Thank you.

248
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:22,009
Any messages for 3087

249
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,220
All right.

250
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:27,681
Hey, hey, fellers.
Michael!

251
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:28,807
Hey, Michael!
What's up?

252
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,768
Well, Jim and I have a meeting
with uni-ball in about 45 minutes,

253
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,854
so we should probably go now.
Hey, check this out!

254
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:36,565
How about that?
A little friendly competition.

255
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:40,235
Stamford versus Scranton. I
don't think so... I don't really...

256
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,115
Jim, looks like you picked a
bad time to defect, my friend.

257
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,453
Fine, all right.
Okay! Excellent.

258
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,040
Do the wing flaps.
Oh, just shut it.

259
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:55,667
Hey, Pam, what's up?

260
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:01,173
Yeah. No, tell him I will give him
general specifics tomorrow, okay?

261
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,383
Yes. Say hi to Pam!

262
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,801
Hi, Pam!
Hi, Pam.

263
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,387
Yes. That is Josh
and Dwight and Jim.

264
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,056
Pam says hi.

265
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,807
Have fun on your date.

266
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,518
Very good,
talk to you later. Bye.

267
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,443
You first!

268
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,028
Come on.

269
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,571
Nice try, Josh!

270
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:26,656
Not. Hit the... Hit the rim.

271
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,283
Okay, and...

272
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:32,454
Okay, double or nothing.

273
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,040
On what? We didn't bet
anything, Michael, we...

274
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,584
Well, we... Let's... You know,
we should go. We gotta go.

275
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,545
Come on. Come on!
We'll do it later.

276
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,630
Let's go...

277
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,298
Say, while I have you here,

278
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,342
could I talk to you about some
new and exciting advances

279
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,927
to our product line?
Fine.

280
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,929
Jim and I have different
definitions of friendship.

281
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,181
I think it's talking
and being friends,

282
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:53,392
and Jim thinks
it's moving to Connecticut

283
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,936
and being best friends
with Josh. Well...

284
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:59,898
Phooey on that.

285
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:03,652
I'm done. I am not going to
be speaking with him anymore.

286
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,822
Whatevs. Long-distance
relationships never work.

287
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,532
That is so true.

288
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,909
Ready?

289
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,454
Okay, let me tell you what
we're looking for. Great.

290
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,500
Sorry,
my meeting ran late.

291
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,878
Really?
Yes, Jan, really,

292
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,255
with the rep from Hammermill.

293
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,631
They're exclusive
with Staples.

294
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:25,882
Used to be.

295
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:28,176
Evan'll call you in the
morning to work out the details.

296
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,345
We can now
sell Hammermill products.

297
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,888
Yes!

298
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,852
Well, Michael, I just...
I underestimated you.

299
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:40,522
Yeah, well, maybe next time
you will estimate me.

300
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,485
Dwight's room key.

301
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,071
And Dwight's room.

302
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,658
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.

303
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:52,868
D?

304
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,330
Oh, my God!
Dwight got a hooker!

305
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,333
Oh, my God, I gotta call...

306
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,128
Well, I gotta call somebody,
I don't even know who to call.

307
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:04,963
Dwight got a hooker!

308
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,508
So, Alan, Pam is
obsessed with your cartoons.

309
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,469
She reads them every day.

310
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,928
Oh, great.

311
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,306
I don't like ketchup.
You love ketchup!

312
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:15,849
He loves ketchup.

313
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,144
So how do you come up
with your cartoons?

314
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,524
Oh, I just... I kind of
think about stuff that I see.

315
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,651
Or dream them.

316
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,113
You dream in cartoons?
How fun.

317
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:34,826
Hey! First guest!

318
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,579
You are going to have
some tequila, my friend.

319
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,999
I thought there was a party
in here. This is the party.

320
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,668
This is Room 308?
Party central!

321
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,296
So what can I do you for?
All right.

322
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,426
See, this one is great

323
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,471
because it could work
on a couple different levels.

324
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:58,975
"More freedom fries
for the table?"

325
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,561
"Freedom fries". Yeah.

326
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,608
Yeah, I mean, people always
say, like, "Don't be edgy,"

327
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,694
but I don't know...
I don't know any other way.

328
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,572
Yeah, you got it.

329
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,507
Well, it was... It was really
nice meeting you, Alan.

330
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,175
Yeah, next time bring
some of your illustrations.

331
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,052
I'll let you pick my brain.

332
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,721
"More freedom fries"!
Yeah!

333
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,306
That's great.
Okay.

334
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,016
I went on a date.

335
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,643
It wasn't a love connection.

336
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:46,898
I think when I like someone
again, I'll just kind of know.

337
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,044
Michael.

338
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,385
Am I the first to arrive?

339
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,054
People have been
filtering in and out.

340
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:22,350
Can I get a drink?
What?

341
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,769
Can I get a drink?

342
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,605
Sure.

343
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:34,446
Do you like Cosmos?
Yeah, sure, sounds good.

344
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,491
So why are you here?
Is Josh busy?

345
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,368
Michael...
I get it!

346
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,203
Did I do something or...
No. No, I totally get it!

347
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,289
He made
a better paper airplane,

348
00:18:44,372 --> 00:18:46,708
Stamford does better
in sales. You...

349
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:50,253
I get it, we had some fun.
We had some laughs...

350
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,214
Wait, wait, wait. I didn't
transfer because of you.

351
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,550
You're a good boss.

352
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,510
You're a great boss.

353
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,224
I'm not better than Josh.

354
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,477
Michael, it's not about...

355
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,105
I transferred because of Pam.

356
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,567
Oh, my God.

357
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,821
You don't even know.
She's single now.

358
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,532
No, I... I heard something
about that.

359
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,161
It's just... I kind of
put it all on the line.

360
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,707
Twice, actually.
And she said no.

361
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,085
Twice.

362
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,632
I'm sorry, man,
I'm sorry, it's...

363
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,636
Hey, you know what?
I will talk to her.

364
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,845
Nope, that's okay.

365
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,971
Yeah.
No, that's all right.

366
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,224
I will. I'll talk to her.

367
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,477
You should at least
talk to Roy,

368
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,897
I mean, he knows exactly
how you're feeling, just...

369
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,607
Yeah.

370
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,110
Okay, maybe.

371
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,237
Are we early?

372
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,407
Hey! No, you know, people
have been filtering in and out.

373
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,284
Hey. Evan, this is Jim.
How are you?

374
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,371
Hey, Arnie Rissman,
Michael, Jim.

375
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:07,622
Hey, Arnie, how you doing?

376
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,874
You guys work together?

377
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,334
No, we used to.
Yeah.

378
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,878
Now we're friends.
Best friends.

379
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:21,136
Some people need dozens of friends
to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular!”

380
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:25,140
But not me. I'm very picky.
I need three, maybe two.

381
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,727
When you meet that someone
special, you'll just know,

382
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,187
because a real relationship,

383
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,648
it can't be forced.

384
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:37,152
It should just
come about effortlessly.

385
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:43,032
Now would you do me the
pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?

386
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,540
What are
all those stains?

387
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:52,500
Blood, urine,
or semen.

388
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,461
Oh, God,
I hope it's urine.
