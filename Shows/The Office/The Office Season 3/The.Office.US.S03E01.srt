1
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:15,348
Yeah,
I'm not a temp anymore.

2
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,475
I got Jim's old job,

3
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,185
which means at my
10-year high school reunion,

4
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:21,729
it will not say,
"Ryan Howard is a temp."

5
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:24,774
It will say, "Ryan Howard
is a junior sales associate

6
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,901
"at a mid-range
paper supply firm."

7
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,946
That'll show them.

8
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,217
You have no idea how
long I've wanted to do that.

9
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,719
Me, too.

10
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,391
I think we're just drunk.

11
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:00,643
No, I'm not drunk.

12
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:03,396
Are you drunk?

13
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:06,983
Jim.

14
00:01:10,778 --> 00:01:12,863
You're really
going to marry him?

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,034
Okay.

16
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,335
Jim is gone.

17
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,922
He's gone. I miss him so much.

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,801
I cry myself to sleep. Jim.

19
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:36,304
False. I do not miss him.

20
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,755
No. That is the fun
of this place.

21
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:13,716
I call everybody faggy. Why
would anyone find that offensive?

22
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,385
Okay. I think Oscar would just like it if
you used lame or something like that.

23
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,012
That's what faggy means.

24
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,639
No, not really.

25
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,475
Apparently you called
Oscar faggy.

26
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:23,559
Yeah.

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,729
For liking the movie Shakespeare
in Love more than an action movie.

28
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:29,106
It wasn't just an action
movie, it was Die Hard.

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,317
All right, Michael,
but Oscar's really gay.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,985
Exactly.
I mean for real.

31
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,195
Yeah, I know.

32
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,072
No. He's attracted
to other men.

33
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,116
Okay. Little too far.
Crossed the line.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,077
Okay. I am telling you,

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,746
Oscar is an actual homosexual.

36
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,584
Yeah. He told me
this morning.

37
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,004
And obviously he hopes he
can count on your discretion.

38
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,215
I would have never
called him that if I knew.

39
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:59,053
You don't call
retarded people retards.

40
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,638
It's bad taste.

41
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:04,433
You call your friends retards
when they're acting retarded.

42
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,103
And I consider Oscar a friend.

43
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,399
Listen, man, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.

44
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,859
Oh, it's fine. It's
okay. It's okay.
No. No.

45
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,446
It's okay. No, it's not. I
just... I feel terrible about it.

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,659
I have been calling people
faggy since I was in junior high,

47
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:24,078
and I have never made
this mistake.

48
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,330
If I don't know how to behave,

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,835
it is because I am
just so far the opposite way.

50
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,294
You know? I'm just...

51
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,674
I... I can't even
imagine the thing...

52
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:41,721
Maybe we could go out for a beer
sometime and you could tell me

53
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,265
how you do that
to another dude.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,729
That sounds like a great,
wonderful idea. Let's do that.

55
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,833
It explains so much.

56
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:14,503
No. I'm not gay.

57
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:19,675
And I don't understand why
anyone would think that I'm gay if...

58
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,686
Yeah, I'm gay.

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,276
I can't say whether Dunder
Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir,

60
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,946
but I can assure you that it is
certainly not more flammable.

61
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,907
Why did I transfer
to Stamford?

62
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,785
I think that's pretty obvious.

63
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,413
I got promoted.

64
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,874
And you can't beat
that view, right?

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,086
Hey, Big Tuna,
you're single, right?

66
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:57,963
Yeah, I am.

67
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,425
Pretty hot, huh?

68
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,680
She's completely crazy.

69
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,018
Steer clear, Big Tuna.

70
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,354
Head for open waters.

71
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,941
Okay.
Okay.

72
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:24,615
I ate a tuna sandwich on my first
day, so Andy started calling me Big Tuna.

73
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,537
I don't think any of them
actually know my real name.

74
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:32,581
Big Tuna
is a super ambitious guy,

75
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,583
you know, cut your throat
to get ahead type of guy.

76
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,711
But, I mean,
I'm not threatened by him.

77
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,549
I went to Cornell.
You ever heard of it?

78
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,717
I graduated in four years,
I never studied once,

79
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,594
I was drunk the whole time

80
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,558
and I sang in the a cappella
group Here Comes Treble.

81
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:55,771
So, end of day, we are going to
have a little diversity policy freshener,

82
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,774
because of some more problems
at the Scranton branch.

83
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,862
And I have a list of business
start-ups I got from the chamber.

84
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,865
Yes. I am going to need
someone to cold call them.

85
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,700
Oh, I can do that.

86
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,119
Jim's nice enough.

87
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:13,163
I don't know
how well he's fitting in here.

88
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:18,085
He's always looking
at the camera, like this.

89
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,838
What is that?

90
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:23,716
Can you tell who's gay
and who is not? Of course.

91
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,509
What about Oscar?

92
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,096
Absolutely not.
Well, he is.

93
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,475
Well, he's not dressed
in women's clothes, so...

94
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,645
There could be others.

95
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,815
I need to know. I don't
want to offend anybody else.

96
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,236
You could assume everyone is
and not say anything offensive.

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,487
Yeah.

98
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,575
I'm sure everyone would appreciate
me treating them like they were gay.

99
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,370
Hey, what about Angela?

100
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,498
She's hard and severe.
She could be a gay woman.

101
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,752
I really don't think so.
I don't know.

102
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:03,797
I can imagine her
with another woman, can't you?

103
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,968
Do some research.

104
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,388
Find out if there's a way to
tell by just looking at them.

105
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,642
Jim told me you could buy
gaydar online.

106
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,519
That's ridiculous.
Yeah. Probably.

107
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,647
He didn't tell
the truth a lot.

108
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,734
Let's call him and get
the website. Definitely.

109
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,486
What's gaydar?

110
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,698
Oh, oh, gaydar, yes! No, I think
they have it at Sharper Image.

111
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,242
Oh, you know what?
I can check for you.

112
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,452
No problem.

113
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,333
It's sold out.

114
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,670
Yeah. Sorry about that.
That's a bummer.

115
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,631
They're sold out.
Damn.

116
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll try Brookstone.

117
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:54,890
I miss that.

118
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,319
Chicken or fish?

119
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,697
Chicken.

120
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:16,370
So, you having a good day?
Excellent. Thanks.

121
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,956
Good. I'm glad.

122
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,418
Okay.

123
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,008
Yeah, I didn't go through
with the wedding.

124
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,510
I got cold feet
a few days before,

125
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:33,595
and I can't really explain it.

126
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,931
I just had to get out
of that relationship.

127
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:40,102
We still had to pay for
all the food, so we froze it.

128
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:43,105
But I'm doing well.

129
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:47,317
I have my own apartment
and I'm taking art classes.

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,571
And I have lunch
for the next five weeks.

131
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,365
After Pam dumped me,

132
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,661
I kind of stopped taking care
of myself for a while there,

133
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,206
and I hit bottom when
I had a drunk driving arrest.

134
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,795
Yeah, I've been working out
and, you know,

135
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,757
I'm not going
to take her for granted.

136
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,764
I got to win her back.

137
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,391
I got them a toaster.

138
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,936
They called off the wedding
and gave the toaster back to me.

139
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,689
I tried to return the toaster
to the store and they said

140
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,941
they no longer sold
that kind of toaster.

141
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,236
So now my house
has got two toasters.

142
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:40,829
It is so cool that you're gay.
I totally underestimated you.

143
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,708
Yes, I am super cool.

144
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,543
I am an accountant

145
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,714
at a failing paper supply
company in Scranton.

146
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,926
Much like Sir Ian McKellen.

147
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,934
Sure, sometimes I watch
Will ♪ Grace and I want to throw up.

148
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,144
It's terribly loud.

149
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:08,774
I do like it sometimes
when Harry Connick Jr. is on.

150
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,485
He's so talented.

151
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,294
Okay,

152
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,713
who put my calculator
in JELL-O?

153
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,386
Good one.

154
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:42,015
But, seriously,
guys, who did this?

155
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,981
Seriously, guys. Who did this?

156
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,944
I need to know who put
my calculator in JELL-O

157
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,114
or I'm going to lose
my freaking mind!

158
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,251
You know, it's amazing to me
that in this day and age,

159
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:13,630
you can be so obtuse
about sexual orientation.

160
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,842
- I watch The I Word, okay?
- Good. Good.

161
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,136
I watch Queer as... so...

162
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,637
That's not what it's called.

163
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,891
Okay, Michael, are you aware
that you outed Oscar today?

164
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,851
What? What does that even...

165
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,813
Coming out is a significant
moment for a gay person.

166
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,024
And they should be allowed
to select the timing

167
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,734
and manner of announcing it.

168
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,944
Well, gay pride, right?

169
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,654
Gay pride parade.

170
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,158
It's not, like,
gay shame festival.

171
00:11:41,241 --> 00:11:45,037
All right, now Oscar's feeling
discriminated against by his co-workers,

172
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,081
primarily Angela,
and that's your fault.

173
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,584
I think Angela might be gay.

174
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,878
Could Oscar and Angela
be having a gay affair?

175
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:55,297
No! Maybe. Is
that what this is about?

176
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,592
No. No. It's not possible.
I don't...

177
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:03,889
Anything's possible. Okay,
you know, imagine you were gay.

178
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,892
Well, I'm not gay, Jan,

179
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,019
and you should know that
better than anybody.

180
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:13,607
Michael, your immaturity
is extremely disappointing

181
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,234
and may even lead
to a lawsuit,

182
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,569
which is the absolute last thing
this company needs right now.

183
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,071
Yes.
Do you understand?

184
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,155
I know.

185
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,367
The company has made it
my responsibility today

186
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:28,997
to put an end to 100,000 years
of being weirded out by gays.

187
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,625
Am I the first gay man
you ever knew?

188
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,378
Trick question.

189
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,965
"Cause you can't always tell,
so how would I know?

190
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,217
Was that the right answer?

191
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,386
Yup.

192
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,722
Michael, Dwight's looking at
gay pornography on his computer.

193
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,892
Michael knows, Pam, okay? He
asked me to do this just for him.

194
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,644
He has his own reasons.

195
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,649
Okay.

196
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,695
Nothing wrong
with this stuff at all.

197
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,029
This is fine.

198
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,242
You know what? Gay porn,
straight porn, it's all good.

199
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:10,330
I don't particularly get
into this but, you know what,

200
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,625
I totally see the merit.
And actually,

201
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,794
it is quite beautiful.

202
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:17,963
Oh, damn pop-ups.
What are you doing?

203
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:21,591
Watching some of your friends.
This is stupid. Excuse me.

204
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,051
Don't touch me!

205
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,139
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa
Stop it!

206
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:29,099
All right, everybody
in the conference room!

207
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:32,644
I don't care if you are
gay, or straight,

208
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,981
or a lesbian or overweight,
just get in here!

209
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,232
Right now!

210
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,237
Did you know that gay
used to mean happy?

211
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,366
When I was growing up,
it meant lame.

212
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,495
And now it means a man

213
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,707
who makes love to other men.

214
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,085
We're all homos, Homo sapiens.

215
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,962
Gays aren't necessarily
who you think they are...

216
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,130
What?
...people.

217
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,549
I mean, anybody can be gay.

218
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:06,345
Businessmen,
like antique dealers,

219
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,806
or hairdressers or

220
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
accountants.

221
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:16,438
Oscar, why don't you take this
opportunity to officially come out

222
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:19,941
to everybody here
however you want to do it?

223
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,612
Go ahead. Stand up.

224
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,031
I'm doing this for you.

225
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,868
Yes, I'm gay.

226
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:35,457
And I didn't plan on sharing
that part of my life with you today,

227
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,168
so, whatever.

228
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,461
Can I sit down now?

229
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,755
I'm not offended
by homosexuality.

230
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,135
In the '60s, I made love to many,
many women, often outdoors,

231
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,221
in the mud and the rain,

232
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:52,307
and it's possible
a man slipped in.

233
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
There would be
no way of knowing.

234
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:59,481
Who should be the judges
and juries of our society?

235
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:01,942
Judges and juries.
Yes.

236
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,985
That's a good point.
She has a good point.

237
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:09,366
Because gay marriage currently
is not legal under U.S. law.

238
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,245
I bet a lot of straight men
wished that applied to them

239
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,789
so they could go out there
and have some torrid,

240
00:15:15,872 --> 00:15:19,709
unabashed monkey sex as
much as they could. You know?

241
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,879
Sounds pretty good, right?
That sounds great.

242
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,172
Yeah, Dwight.

243
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,426
I think all the other office
gays should identify themselves

244
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,510
or I will do it for them.

245
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,303
No one else
in this office is gay.

246
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,555
What about Phyllis?

247
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,391
She makes absolutely
no attempt to be feminine.

248
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:37,060
I'm getting married to Bob
Vance. - You are?

249
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,688
No way! RYAN:
Congratulations, Phyllis.

250
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,898
- When did you get that?
- That's great.

251
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:46,653
Congratulations, Phyllis. That is
great, and frankly, kind of amazing.

252
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,322
See? Everybody has a chance.
Thank you.

253
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,659
But, still Phyllis,
in college,

254
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:54,661
did you ever experiment
with other women?

255
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,080
A lot of women do.

256
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,624
No, and you knew me
in high school.

257
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,336
Of course, we all thought
you were gay in high school.

258
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,463
Right.

259
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,177
And I take that
as a compliment.

260
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,262
Well, with your ties
and your matching socks...

261
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,764
Well, I just like to look
good, okay? So...

262
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,349
You sound pretty defensive,
Michael.

263
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:20,228
No. I am just coming out
myself. I am coming out hetero!

264
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,355
I think the problem
with this office is

265
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,108
that you are sending mixed
signals about my being here.

266
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:29,988
No. No. The only signal
that I am sending is gay good!

267
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,658
Look, if I was gay,

268
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:38,163
I would be the most
flamboyant gay you've ever seen.

269
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:42,584
I would be leading the parade
covered in feathers and just...

270
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,754
I'd be waving
that rainbow flag.

271
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,965
I don't think I can work
here any longer.

272
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,927
This has been the worst,

273
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,387
most backwards day of my life.

274
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,723
You misunderstand...
Okay. All right...

275
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:59,142
You know what? Okay. Okay.

276
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,646
I'm going to put my money
where my mouth is.

277
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:04,064
You ready?
What are you doing?

278
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,816
I am going to embrace Oscar.
You might want to watch us, Angela,

279
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,236
because you can't catch
anything. Here we go.

280
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,779
We are going to
make a statement. No.

281
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:14,074
You and I are going
to make a statement together.

282
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,909
Oscar is my friend.
I'd rather not.

283
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,370
And I just don't care
who sees it.

284
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:20,455
Doesn't bother me. Really,
I really would rather not.

285
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,873
Come here, friend.
I'd really rather not.

286
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,167
You're my friend.
No! No!

287
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,921
I don't want to touch you.
Ever considered that?

288
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:31,675
You're ignorant
and insulting and small.

289
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:33,969
Okay.

290
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,934
All right.

291
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,608
I'm sorry. Michael, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:52,779
That was a good idea. Come on.

293
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,698
Come on.

294
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,409
All right.

295
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,954
I'm sorry I called you faggy.
I know. I know.

296
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:02,622
You're not faggy.
I know you are.

297
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,208
You're a good guy.
You, too.

298
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,252
Michael
appears to be gay, too.

299
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,796
And yet he is my friend.

300
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,258
I guess I do
have a gay friend.

301
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:16,094
You know what,
I'm going to raise the stakes.

302
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:17,429
You don't...

303
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,180
I want you to watch this

304
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:23,810
and I want you to burn
this into your brains.

305
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,186
I don't think
we need to do this...

306
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,814
Because this is an image

307
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:32,360
that I want you people to
remember for a long time to come.

308
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,031
Whenever you come into the
office, I want you to think about this.

309
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,657
We don't need to.

310
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
Yes, we do.
What?

311
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,635
I did it!

312
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,680
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

313
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:01,890
See,

314
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,726
I'm still here.

315
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,312
We're all still here.

316
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,195
Oh, come on, Dwight!
Come on, man!

317
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:19,199
We are not in the playground
anymore. There are new rules.

318
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,660
We have to be mature,

319
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:27,040
but we can't lose the spirit
of childlike wonder.

320
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,835
What is love anyway?

321
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,547
Maybe it's supposed
to break all the rules.

322
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:36,758
Like me and Jan.

323
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:40,970
Or Oscar and some guy.
Life is short.

324
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
When two people
find each other,

325
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,643
what should stand
in their way?

326
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,521
It is very easy
for you to be a hero.

327
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:53,650
All you need are honesty, empathy,
respect and open-mindedness.

328
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:57,028
I'm glad if today
spurred social change.

329
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,239
That's part of my job
as regional manager.

330
00:19:59,322 --> 00:20:01,491
But, you know what,
even if it didn't,

331
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:04,077
at least we put
this matter to bed.

332
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,831
That's what she said.
Or he said.

333
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,379
Oh, there's Gil,
Oscar's roommate.

334
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,803
I wonder if he knows.

335
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,473
I was going to quit,

336
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,478
but Jan offered me a three-month,
paid vacation and a company car.

337
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,440
All I had to do was sigh
something saying I won't sue.

338
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,735
Gil and I are going to Europe.

339
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,196
Kids, sometimes it pays
to be gay.

340
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:48,705
"Hope this helps. Jim."

341
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,338
Nice.

342
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,842
What are you doing?
Don't be scared.

343
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,685
It works.

344
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:18,485
Oh, no.
