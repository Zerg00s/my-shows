1
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,380
Oh, damn.
I lost another file.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,175
Gonna have to reboot, again.

3
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:13,763
Hey, Dwight,
do you want an Altoid?

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,806
What do you think?

5
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,479
In school, we learned
about this scientist

6
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,398
who trained dogs to salivate
at the sound of a bell

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,692
by feeding them
whenever a bell rang.

8
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,237
So,
for the past couple weeks,

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,989
I've been conducting
a similar experiment.

10
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:36,661
Dwight, want an Altoid?
Okay.

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:41,499
Altoid?
Sure.

12
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,587
Mint, Dwight?
"Mint, Dwight?"

13
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:48,714
Yes.

14
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,597
What are you doing?

15
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,975
I...

16
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,395
What?
I don't know. I...

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,773
My mouth tastes
so bad all of a sudden.

18
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,438
Always the bridesmaids,
right, ladies?

19
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,732
Okay, for this next
one, everybody hop out.

20
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,567
Just Phyllis and Dad.

21
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,654
Actually, let's bring Mom
back in and the sisters

22
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:56,073
and you and you and you.

23
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,452
Great.

24
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,788
Phyllis is getting
married and I am in the wedding party.

25
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,666
She has asked me to push her
father's wheelchair down the aisle.

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,794
So, basically, I am
co-giving away the bride.

27
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,172
Since I pay her salary

28
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:14,925
it is like I'm paying for the
wedding, which I'm happy to do.

29
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,677
It's a big day for Phyllis,

30
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,804
but it's an even
bigger day for me.

31
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,931
Employer of the Bride.

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,852
Yes.
I put Michael in my wedding.

33
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,396
It was the only way
I could think to get

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,398
six weeks off
for my honeymoon.

35
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,943
No one else has ever
gotten six weeks before.

36
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:38,449
Phyllis ended up using the exact
same invitations as Roy and me.

37
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,120
So, it was kind of like being
invited to my own wedding.

38
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,415
And I was like, "Wait,
I thought I called that off?"

39
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,170
So, what's in the box?
A toaster.

40
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,380
You?

41
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,631
A toaster.

42
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,549
Unbelievable.

43
00:02:58,844 --> 00:02:59,845
Hello, Angela.

44
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:00,930
Hi, Dwight.

45
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:04,308
You look as beautiful
as the Queen of England.

46
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,893
Thank you.

47
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,937
Don't linger. Break left.

48
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,190
Left.

49
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,781
The Schrutes
have their own traditions.

50
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:22,034
We usually marry
standing in our own graves.

51
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,370
It makes the funerals
very romantic,

52
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,789
but the weddings
are a bleak affair.

53
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:30,501
- Those flowers are nice.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,294
"P and R"?

55
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,171
Phyllis and Robert?

56
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,631
Oh, of course.

57
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,758
Also, Pam and Roy.

58
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,263
There she is.

59
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,391
I swear, Phyllis,
you are as beautiful

60
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:48,185
as the first day you started
work at Dunder Mifflin.

61
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,020
Thanks, Michael.
That's sweet.

62
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,231
Same as when you
said it outside.

63
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,568
How you doing?
Are you excited?

64
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,194
Yes, very.
Me, too.

65
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:02,491
If you need to vomit,
that is okay. I did.

66
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,535
Do you want to
talk about tonight?

67
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:05,703
No.

68
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,539
Because I know you're probably
worried about pleasing Bob.

69
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:09,999
A lot of pressure.

70
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,378
Phyllis,
did you break wind?

71
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:19,008
It's okay if you did,
it's a very natural reaction.

72
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,260
It's your wedding,
and you're nervous...

73
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,596
That wasn't me.

74
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,097
Okay.

75
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,144
I'm sure that Bob...

76
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,773
Wow, that is...

77
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,151
That is pungent.

78
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,613
I lost my train of thought.

79
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:44,283
Are you set on
that hairstyle?

80
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,495
I thought it was...
Michael, no... Here, let me.

81
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,121
I don't need your help.
Thank you, no.

82
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,289
Just cover up
that bald patch.

83
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:52,041
Michael, please.
I just need some time alone.

84
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,959
Okay. Okay.

85
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,419
You might be
surprised to learn that

86
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,421
I've only been to
one other wedding.

87
00:04:58,422 --> 00:04:59,924
It's actually
a very cute story.

88
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:03,260
My mom was marrying Jeff, and
they asked me to be ring bearer.

89
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,763
And I was
understandably emotional

90
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>and somehow
my pants became wet.</i>

91
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,812
I hate you!

92
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:17,775
A long story short, Jeff's
dog ended up as ring bearer.

93
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:21,612
And the irony is that,
after the ceremony

94
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,616
that dog peed on everything

95
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,118
and nobody said boo.

96
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,538
Why are all these
people here?

97
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,206
There's too many
people on this Earth.

98
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:33,707
We need a new plague.

99
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,334
Who are all these people?

100
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,169
You know what?

101
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,838
I bet a lot of them
are wedding crashers.

102
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,756
No way.
Did you ever see that movie?

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,841
Of course I saw it.

104
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,134
I saw Wedding Crashers
accidentally.

105
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,427
I bought
a ticket for Grizzly Man

106
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,804
and went into
the wrong theater.

107
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,848
After an hour, I figured I
was in the wrong theater,

108
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,266
but I kept waiting.

109
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,226
Because that's the
thing about bear attacks,

110
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:54,019
they come when
you least expect it.

111
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,521
You know, I just wish...

112
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,523
I wish I had
the investigative powers

113
00:05:57,606 --> 00:06:00,484
to actually smoke some of
these guys out, you know?

114
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,489
Once again, Jim,
I will take care of this.

115
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:09,243
I will locate the wedding
crashers and report them to Phyllis.

116
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,538
That way I won't
have to get her a gift.

117
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,373
Hi, I'm Kevin.

118
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,127
Where did you find her?

119
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,087
At the gym.

120
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,464
Right.

121
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,134
The gym...

122
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,680
Could you scoot over?
You're on my dress.

123
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:31,515
I thought you're not supposed
to wear white to a wedding.

124
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,767
I know,
but there was an emergency.

125
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,353
I look really good
in white.

126
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,316
This strapping, young lad sitting
here is Phyllis' father, Elbert,

127
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,817
and he is quite
the ladies' man.

128
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,611
Aren't you, Elbert? Huh?

129
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:44,945
Ring bearer.

130
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,072
I could have done better.

131
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,577
I will do better.
I am going to be better.

132
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,621
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

133
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,791
Are you ready for this,
Elbert? I am.

134
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,210
Let's do it!

135
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,678
That's my dress.

136
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:29,990
It's...

137
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:50,761
This is...

138
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:54,890
Me walking
Phyllis down the aisle

139
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,017
was supposed to be
the highlight of the wedding.

140
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,437
And now,
the wedding has no highlight.

141
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:14,702
I can't believe I pushed that
guy's lazy ass around all day

142
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,330
until he was ready to
stand up and steal the show.

143
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,665
That's...

144
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:23,836
Well, I've got news for you,
Elbert, if that's your real name,

145
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,255
the show's not over.

146
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:05,461
And do you, Phyllis, take Bob
Vance, Vance Refrigeration,

147
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:07,463
to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

148
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:08,547
I do.

149
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,341
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present to you,

150
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,596
for the first time as a couple,
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,273
And do you, Bob, take Phyllis
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

152
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,025
I do.

153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,151
You may now kiss the bride.

154
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,235
Ladies and gentlemen,

155
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,614
for the first time as a couple,
Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!

156
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,453
That's what
I'm talking about!

157
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,707
Congratulations, Phyllis.
You look lovely.

158
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you.

159
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,127
Your dress is very white.

160
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,254
It's so white,
my eyes are burning.

161
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,339
Thanks, Angela.

162
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,300
Congratulations, Bob.
You're a good man.

163
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:54,510
But just know,

164
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,596
if you ever lay a finger
on Phyllis, I will kill you.

165
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,475
If you ever lay a finger
on Phyllis, I'll kill you.

166
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,229
Agreed. No fingers
will be laid on Phyllis.

167
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,357
Oh, decided to
sit down again, huh?

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,692
Great.
Bet you can hear me, too?

169
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,319
Best of luck, Phyllis.

170
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:14,488
Also, I'm gonna need to see
a copy of the guest manifest

171
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,365
as well as
photographs of the caterers.

172
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:18,075
I don't have that, Dwight.

173
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,535
Damn it, Phyllis!

174
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,205
Are you all right?

175
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,706
This must be
so awful for you.

176
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,958
What do you mean?

177
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,377
Well, this is supposed
to be your wedding.

178
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,586
Oh!

179
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,423
No, that's actually fine.

180
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,634
There's no way it's fine.
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:36,969
If I was you,
I would just, like,

182
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:38,262
freak out and
get really drunk

183
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,013
and then tell
someone I was pregnant.

184
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,766
Okay. That's a lot
of good ideas. Thanks.

185
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,738
Excuse me, sir, how do
you know the happy couple?

186
00:10:57,072 --> 00:10:58,073
Who?

187
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,409
The bride and groom.
What are their names?

188
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,745
I don't... I'm not sure...

189
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,122
I get it. I get it.

190
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,790
Come on, freeloader.
Let's move it.

191
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,208
Come on. Come on.

192
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,169
Okay, okay.
Where are we going?

193
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:13,005
You've got to find yourself
another wedding to crash, my friend.

194
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:15,924
Phyllis? Are you
happy with everything?

195
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,051
What can I do to
make it more perfecter?

196
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,845
It's beautiful.

197
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,389
Why don't you find your seat
and enjoy the buffet.

198
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:23,807
I'm already on it.
The chicken?

199
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,517
Totally undercooked.
I sent it back.

200
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,060
It's fish.

201
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,645
I will take care of that.

202
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:32,900
I do. I know a fair amount
about fine food and drink.

203
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,196
This is a white.

204
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,448
No, this is not
our first wedding.

205
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:43,368
This is the third wedding
that Scrantonicity has played.

206
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,540
We also played our bassist's
wedding and our guitarist's wedding.

207
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,252
Attention, everyone.
Attention, please.

208
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,673
I'm supposed to ask
if anyone has seen Uncle Al.

209
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:01,595
He is old and has
brown eyes and dementia.

210
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,931
His family is very concerned.

211
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,892
It's a very
serious situation.

212
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,939
Roxanne

213
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,443
You don't have to
put on your red light

214
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,656
Those days are over...

215
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,532
Hey.

216
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:27,162
I know I don't normally
notice these kind of things,

217
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,040
but this wedding's
really nice.

218
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:32,042
I mean,
the flowers and stuff.

219
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,169
Phyllis has got
some great taste.

220
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,587
You're kidding me, right?

221
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,590
I know you probably aren't
gonna remember this, but,

222
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,550
those color roses,

223
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,804
I got you those
color roses for our prom.

224
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,307
Roy, I picked those flowers.

225
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:51,019
Phyllis just stole all of
my ideas for our wedding.

226
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,277
I guess I wasn't really too
involved in the planning.

227
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,361
Yeah.

228
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:00,612
Sorry about that.

229
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,780
It's okay.

230
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,117
Well, you think
it sucks for you?

231
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,287
I'm the one who actually
wanted to get married.

232
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,263
Phyllis,
you're a wonderful woman.

233
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,849
And you're
a hell of a bowler!

234
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:33,520
Cheers.

235
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,688
Cheers!

236
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,774
Thank you, Randy.
That was great. Thank you.

237
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,818
Thank you very much.

238
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,820
Hi I'm Michael Scott.

239
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,239
And, for the next 40 minutes,

240
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,366
I am going to be
your tour guide through

241
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,744
the lives of Phyllis Lapin
and Bob Vance,

242
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:54,708
one of the great, seemingly
impossible, love stories of our time.

243
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,544
<i>My name is Michael Scott.</i>

244
00:13:57,627 --> 00:14:01,465
Webster's
dictionary defines wedding

245
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:06,094
as "the fusing of two metals
with a hot torch.”

246
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:08,680
Well, you know something?

247
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,060
I think you guys
are two medals,

248
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,395
gold medals.

249
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,610
For those of you
who don't know me,

250
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:23,695
I'm Michael Scott,
Phyllis' boss.

251
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,117
To quote from
The Princess Bride,

252
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,871
"Marriage..."”

253
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:36,041
The most important part of
a speech is the opening line.

254
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:40,128
When time is not a factor, I like to
try out three or four different ones.

255
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:44,466
Phyllis and Bob, their
celebrity couple name would be

256
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,301
Flob.

257
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,891
You look at her, and she's
kind of matronly today,

258
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:58,230
but back in high school, I swear
her nickname was Easy Rider.

259
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,650
Now, as for Bob. Bob Vance...

260
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,777
Okay, that's enough. Thanks.
...is a guy...

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,237
Thanks, Michael.
Give me the mike.

262
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,571
He works...
Okay, hold on, hold on...

263
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,656
Look...

264
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:13,286
I didn't say anything when Phyllis's
dad upstaged me at the ceremony.

265
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,746
And I think you
owe me this, okay?

266
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,914
Give me the microphone.

267
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:16,998
No, I'm not going to.

268
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,083
Michael,
give me the microphone.

269
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,043
It's okay. You're out
of here. Okay, good.

270
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,586
Yeah, you're out of here.
You're...

271
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,296
I hate you!

272
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,097
A year has passed
since I wrote my note

273
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:35,100
Hey.

274
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,021
When are we gonna get to see some
of those famous Beesly dance moves?

275
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,607
I'm pacing myself.

276
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,733
Come on.

277
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,194
Get out there. Give the
people what they want.

278
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,696
No. I'm such a dorky dancer.

279
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,657
I know.
And it's very cute.

280
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:56,830
Hypothetically, if I thought
Pam was interested, then,

281
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,293
no,
it's totally hypothetical.

282
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,718
Come on.
I can't let you in, Michael.

283
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,596
Dwight, just... No. It's
Bob and Phyllis's orders.

284
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,017
Look, I just wanted to go in and
quietly sit, and have a piece of cake.

285
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,478
I'm not even gonna dance,
one song, maybe...

286
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,189
You are a real life wedding
crasher and I must bounce you.

287
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,982
I'm sorry,
it gives me no pleasure.

288
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,442
Okay.

289
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:40,540
You remember me
when the west wind moves

290
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,669
Upon the fields of barley

291
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,840
You'll forget
the sun in his jealous way

292
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,636
As we walk in fields of gold

293
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,849
So she took her love

294
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,351
For to gaze...

295
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,855
Even after you're gone

296
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,275
And I know that you love...

297
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,610
Hey!

298
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,780
They're playing
our song, huh?

299
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,990
Yeah, that's weird.

300
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,617
I thought they only
played The Police.

301
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:17,827
I know. I...

302
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,122
I gave them 20 bucks.

303
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,252
You wanna dance?

304
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:39,432
Dreams last so long

305
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,104
Even after you're gone

306
00:17:45,313 --> 00:17:46,982
And I know

307
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,525
That you love me

308
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:53,029
And soon you will see

309
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,615
You were meant for me

310
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,617
And I was meant for you

311
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,452
And I was meant for you

312
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:06,042
Hey, you wanna
get out of here?

313
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,518
Here's a non-hypothetical,

314
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,729
I'm really happy
I'm with Karen.

315
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:28,857
Every little thing
she does is magic

316
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,651
<i>Everything she do
just turns me on</i>

317
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,113
Even though my
life before was tragic

318
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:37,824
Now I know my
love for her goes on

319
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:42,287
One, two, three!

320
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,171
Toby... Yeah!

321
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,882
I just want Phyllis
to have a great day.

322
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,011
Phyllis and you
will be great together.

323
00:18:58,928 --> 00:19:01,806
We are great together.
We are a great team.

324
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,101
The Celtics
were a great team.

325
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,189
Yes. Yes, they were.

326
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,815
Robert Parish...

327
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:17,072
I should talk to her. I don't
want this to ruin her honeymoon.

328
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,576
Well, nobody ever helped me.
I had to do it myself.

329
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,745
Even the doctor didn't know.

330
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:25,163
Dude, keep it together.

331
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,873
I listened to you
for a half an hour

332
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:30,001
even though most of that
stuff went right over my head.

333
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,470
Hey!

334
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,721
Yeah!

335
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,849
Phyllis?
Phyllis, wait, please.

336
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,726
I'm sorry. I just...

337
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,854
I just wanted to make
this a day to remember.

338
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,690
You found Uncle All

339
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,359
Yeah, yeah.
He's kind of a weirdo.

340
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,194
Thank you, Michael.

341
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,238
You're... You're welcome.

342
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:01,116
They say that your
wedding day goes by in such a flash

343
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,368
that you're lucky if you even
get a piece of your own cake.

344
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,954
I say, that's crazy.

345
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,623
I say, "Let them eat cake."

346
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,836
Margaret Thatcher
said that about marriage.

347
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,214
Smart broad.

348
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:22,345
Be careful with the... No!

349
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,514
Oh, wow!

350
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,685
Phyllis. Phyllis, come on.

351
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:30,437
You look like a clown.

352
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,647
Here. Oh, get me. Get me!
