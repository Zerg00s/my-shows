1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,089
Oh, she's absolutely adorable.

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,465
He.

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,927
Oh, sorry. He's...
He's dressed all in pink.

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,137
That's his favorite color.

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,849
Oh, that's fun for him.
Fantastic.

6
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:20,394
Oh, wow, look at that.
How cute.

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,104
Thank you.

8
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,356
Oh, may I?
Oh, sure.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,613
Hey, look at me! I'm a baby.

10
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:33,031
I'm one of those babies
from Look Who's Talking.

11
00:00:33,115 --> 00:00:34,282
What am I thinking?

12
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:39,079
Look at all those staplers. What's a
stapler? I don't even know. I'm a baby.

13
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,705
Hey, Mom! I'm thirsty! I'm
thirsty, Mama! I want some milk!

14
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,923
And you know where
milk comes from? Breasts.

15
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,751
Hey.

16
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,877
Hey.

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,173
Almost done?

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,300
Just about. Yeah.

19
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,427
Now.

20
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:38,013
Yes, I have started
lo see Karen.

21
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,597
It's very new and... Not really
ready to talk about it openly yet

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,937
just because I think,
once the word gets out there,

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,108
it might affect the way
people behave around us or...

24
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,195
I don't know. Just not yet.

25
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:57,783
Yeah, Jan,
it looks like a check,

26
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,703
a piece of paper of some
sort. Receipt. I don't know.

27
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:03,246
Jan, this is Angela Martin
from Accounting.

28
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,585
We have a rebate from the
Federal Work Opportunity Program

29
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,877
and no one knows
what that means.

30
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,421
We get that money
for hiring an ex-convict.

31
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:16,589
I didn't hire an ex-convict, unless
they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.

32
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:20,931
I'm just kidding.

33
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:22,891
When did the check come?

34
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,059
Last week.

35
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,727
Okay, that's when
the branches merged.

36
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:29,064
So Josh must have been taking
advantage of this program. Smart move.

37
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:31,108
One of the Stamford people
is a criminal?

38
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,528
Hey, Jan, speaking of Stamford,
Hannah brought in her baby.

39
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,823
Jan, which one of the new
employees is a criminal?

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,076
A reformed convict,
and I'm not sure

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,829
so hang on, let me e-mail
our H.R. Stay on the line.

42
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,664
Who is it?

43
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,041
Hannah?

44
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,794
Andy?

45
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,338
Andy?

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,382
Martin?

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,176
Oh, you are such a racist.

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,427
Wait, why am I a racist?

49
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,347
Because you think he's black.

50
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,057
He is black, right, and...

51
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,600
He was the last one...
Stop it, stop it right...

52
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,936
Just stop it right now!

53
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,730
Okay, it's someone
named Martin Nash. Yeah!

54
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,106
Michael?

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,690
Why did the convict have to be a
black guy? It is such a stereotype.

56
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,533
I just wish that Josh had made
a more progressive choice,

57
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:21,992
like a white guy

58
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:28,328
who went to prison for
polluting a black guy's lake.

59
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,252
I wonder what he did.

60
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,878
In our society a black man can
be arrested for almost anything.

61
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:45,053
He was probably at a sporting event
and saw some people pushing each other

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,059
and he intervened.

63
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,896
Why would anyone
go to jail for that?

64
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:56,105
So what we need to do
is to forget

65
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,279
about this whole
Martin-in-prison thing.

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:04,072
People will draw unfair conclusions
about Martin and/or black people.

67
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,077
Cool.
Okay.

68
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,456
Angela?

69
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,583
Sure.

70
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,169
Let's protect the convicts

71
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,839
at the expense of the general
feeling of safety in the workplace.

72
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,675
As a 90-pound female
that sits in an ill-lit,

73
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:25,055
rarely-visited corner of the
office, naturally, I agree with that.

74
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,682
Good.

75
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,142
All right.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,942
Jim Halpert.
I am so horny.

77
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:43,615
Okay, I can't help you
with that.

78
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,243
Oh, I think you can, Big Tuna.

79
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,247
Tell me about
that Indian chick, Kelly.

80
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,751
She seems pretty slutty,
good for a romp in the sack.

81
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,711
She is dating Ryan, I think.

82
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:59,172
Oh, and I care, why?

83
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,632
She's high-maintenance.

84
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,926
Next. How about...

85
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,430
Angela?

86
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,769
Blondes are more fun.
Come on, trust me on that.

87
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:14,437
Yeah, trust me.
That would be fun for no one.

88
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,566
Okay, fine.
Okay.

89
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,568
Pam, the receptionist.

90
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:23,280
Pam, should I go for it?

91
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:32,664
Absolutely, you should.

92
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:33,915
Jackpot.

93
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,584
Just try to be cool.
I am cool.

94
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,046
Okay. Are you cool, really?
I'm cool. I'm cool. I'm so cool.

95
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,338
Tell me what is going on.

96
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:47,508
Martin from Stamford
was at one time in prison.

97
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,687
No! Be cool, be cool!

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,191
I am greatly concerned about
having a convict in the office.

99
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:03,775
And I do not care if that convict
is white, black, Asian, German

100
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:08,366
or some kind of halfsy.
I do not like criminals.

101
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,214
Oh, God!

102
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:29,262
All righty, let's get started.
What is she into?

103
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,889
I know Pam pretty well.

104
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,059
I know the things that she
likes, and just as important,

105
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,019
I know the things
that she hates.

106
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:38,980
So one of the things
that she likes is pranks

107
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,816
and the things
that she hates...

108
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,235
Frisbee-based competitions.

109
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,779
Are you kidding? She...

110
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,907
I started the main Frisbee
Golf Club at Cornell

111
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,617
where I went to college.

112
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,620
I live to frolf.

113
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,579
Lead off with that.
Okay...

114
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,997
She loves hunting.

115
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,044
She also loves those ads
for Six Flags with the old guy.

116
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,505
Got it.

117
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,384
Also, do you speak pig Latin?

118
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,678
Hey, Martin. How's it going?

119
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,263
Good.

120
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,433
Getting settled.
Ah, good, good. Good.

121
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:16,518
Just a second.

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,021
Hey, everybody, may I
have your attention, please?

123
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:24,605
I realize that a lot of you have
already heard that Martin, here,

124
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,029
has had some trouble
with the law.

125
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:31,654
But I just want to declare
publicly that I trust him completely

126
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:37,535
and that anybody who doesn't is
an ignorant, dumb person, okay?

127
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:43,044
As a matter of fact, you
show me a white man you trust

128
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:47,132
and I will show you a black
man that I trust even more.

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,803
Pam, tell me
a white person you trust.

130
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:52,304
My dad.

131
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,931
Danny Glover.

132
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,142
Yeah.
Jonas Salk.

133
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,810
Who?
Justin Timberlake?

134
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,313
Oh, please. Colin Powell.

135
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,689
Hey, I've got one.
Yeah.

136
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,525
Jesus.
Apollo Creed.

137
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,153
Close your eyes. Picture a
convict. What's he wearing?

138
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,830
Nothing special. Baseball
cap on backward, baggy pants.

139
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,667
He says something ordinary
like, "Yo, that's shizzle."

140
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,087
Okay, now slowly open
your eyes again.

141
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:29,049
Who are you picturing?
A black man?

142
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,636
Wrong. That was a white woman.

143
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:39,138
Surprised? Well, shame on you.

144
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,271
So, you all wanna know
what I was in for?

145
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,482
No, that's not cool.

146
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,900
You don't have to tell them.

147
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,362
I really don't mind.
It was stupid mistake.

148
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,239
I was working in finance and I
got involved in some insider trading.

149
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,621
So, I spent a little time
in the clink.

150
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,376
That is awesome.

151
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:11,045
I had Martin explain to me three
times what he got arrested for because

152
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,386
it sounds an awful lot like
what I do here every day.

153
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,394
What was prison like?

154
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,855
Not terrible. Boring.

155
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:29,400
We do the same thing every day.
But at least we get outdoors time.

156
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,777
You got outdoors time?

157
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,529
Two hours, every day.

158
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,115
Sometimes we'd play
pick-up football games...

159
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,492
Michael, why don't
we get outdoors time?

160
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,160
Yeah, some days
I never go outside.

161
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,828
Well, we are
running a business.

162
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:43,331
What was your cell like?
Not good.

163
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,543
It's a little bit bigger
than Michael's office,

164
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,172
but, you know, I really
only slept there, you know?

165
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,466
During the day
our time's our own.

166
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:57,720
They had classes. I took
some watercolor classes.

167
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,598
They have art classes?
Yeah.

168
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,308
Did they have
business classes there?

169
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:04,477
They did, taught by some
Harvard Business School guys.

170
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,437
A lot of the guys also
that were in the class,

171
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,398
the inmates,
a lot of them have gone on

172
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,318
to do extraordinary things
in business. Terrible things...

173
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:14,028
It kinda sounds like prison's
better than Dunder Mifflin.

174
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,281
Well, that's not true.

175
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,367
I would so rather be
in prison.

176
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,451
- Yeah.
- Prison sounds great.

177
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,827
No, you would not.

178
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:25,248
This place is not prison. This
place... It's way better than prison.

179
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,502
Baby. Hello, baby.

180
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:30,712
Here, you want
to play with this?

181
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,380
You can't give
paper clips to a baby.

182
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,049
He could swallow them. It's
okay. I've got tons of them.

183
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,301
You like that?

184
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:41,222
Pam-a-lama-ding-dong.

185
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:46,353
Listen, you're cute.
There is no getting around it.

186
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:49,188
So, I don't know if you like
country music,

187
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,899
but I was thinking
maybe one of these days

188
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,944
we could drive out to a field,
crank up some tunes,

189
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:58,527
smoke a few Macanudos,
maybe even toss a disc around.

190
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,993
Ut-way
ooh-day ooh-yay ink-thay, am-Pay?

191
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,247
Wow. I...

192
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,331
Shh.

193
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:08,583
Think about it.

194
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:10,835
I'll hit you back.

195
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:26,514
Wow. That was... Wow.

196
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,191
Okay! Listen up, everybody!

197
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:38,279
You guys said that prison
was better than this place.

198
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,198
And I heard you
loud and clear.

199
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,782
So, I am instituting some changes
to make this more like prison.

200
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,787
We are going to start with an
hour of outdoor time. So let's go!

201
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,884
Michael, it's freezing out.

202
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:01,386
I can't feel my toes.

203
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,721
Why don't we pump some iron?
Anybody wanna pump up?

204
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,561
What is that, like,
five pounds?

205
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,812
It's two-and-a-half.

206
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,064
I'm not going for bulk,
I'm going for tone.

207
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,485
I'm going back inside. Yeah,
it is freaking cold out here.

208
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:20,613
Anybody wants to stay out, you've
got about 27 minutes of rec time.

209
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:25,243
Oh, hey, man.
Hey.

210
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:27,996
Did you have TV in the joint?

211
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,915
Yeah, in the rec room.

212
00:12:29,998 --> 00:12:31,457
Like a 10-inch
black and white?

213
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,751
Actually, our TV
was bigger than that one.

214
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,464
These people
don't realize how lucky they are.

215
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,424
This office is the American dream
and they would rather be in the hole.

216
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,891
Oh, Andy.

217
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:51,311
I thought of one last tack
you could take with Pam.

218
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,897
Yeah? What? Quick question.
Do you play the guitar?

219
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,190
I play the banjo.

220
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,693
Hold on, let me think
about that. Yes, that'll work.

221
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,779
But can you sing in a
sexy, high falsetto voice?

222
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,784
You know I can, my man!

223
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:06,951
Yep, that's perfect.

224
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:09,287
Hey.

225
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,956
Maybe I'll get my banjo
out of my car. Perfect.

226
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,876
What is going on?

227
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,378
I'm messing with Andy.

228
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:20,631
I'm sending him to all the women in
the office with just terrible information

229
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,300
on how to get them
to go out with him.

230
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,677
I love it. I want in.
Who's the target?

231
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,725
Oh, you know what? It was
gonna be Pam... Perfect.

232
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,893
But...
But what do I do?

233
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,688
Just give me an assignment.
Oh, you know what, though?

234
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:37,482
I feel like I
already sicced him on Pam.

235
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,902
We'll give her a break.
Let's think of someone else.

236
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,945
All right, everybody, there has been a lot
of name-calling against our office today,

237
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:51,075
corporate maligning, slurring,
much of it coming from one of you,

238
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,831
who claims that prison
is better than here.

239
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:02,548
And none of us can say, "Boo," because
none of us have ever been to prison.

240
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,595
Well, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

241
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:10,056
Somebody else
who has been to prison,

242
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,060
who can tell you
what it is really like.

243
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,188
I'm Prison Mike!

244
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,442
You know
why they call me Prison Mike?

245
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,860
Do you really expect us to
believe you're somebody else?

246
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:26,822
Do you really expect me to not
push you up against the wall, biatch?

247
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Hey, pass...

248
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,661
All right. Yay, yay, yay, yay. That's
just the way we talk in the clink.

249
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:36,245
Been a lot of fun talk about prison
today, but I am here to scare you straight.

250
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,921
I am here
to scare you straight!

251
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:44,507
In prison you are
somebody's bitch.

252
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,592
Oh, and you. You, my friend,
would be the belle of the ball.

253
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,808
Don't drop the soap.
Don't drop the soap.

254
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,058
Michael, please.

255
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:59,564
Where did you learn
all of this? Internet.

256
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:04,148
So, not prison.
And prison. It's 50-50. Both.

257
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:09,115
Look, prison stinks, is what I'm
saying. It's not like you can go home

258
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,452
and recharge your batteries
and come back in the morning

259
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,372
and be with your friends,
having fun in the office.

260
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,917
What did you do, Prison Mike?

261
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,921
I stole and I robbed

262
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:28,672
and I kidnapped the President's
son and held him for ransom.

263
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,055
That is quite the rap sheet,
Prison Mike.

264
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,890
And I never got caught,
neither.

265
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,142
Well, you were
in prison, but...

266
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,811
Prison Mike, what was
the food like in prison?

267
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:43,437
Gruel sandwiches. Gruel
omelets. Nothing but gruel.

268
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,862
Plus, you can eat
your own hair.

269
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,864
Wow. Prison sounds horrible.

270
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:53,493
Yeah, yeah. Well,
thank you, Andy. Thanks.

271
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,703
Prison Mike,

272
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:57,205
what's the very, very
worst thing about prison?

273
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,040
Don't
encourage him, Dwight.

274
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,336
The worst thing
about prison was the Dementors.

275
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,880
They were flying all over
the place and they were scary

276
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:09,133
and then they'd come down and they'd
suck the soul out of your body and it hurt!

277
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,552
Dementors like
in Harry Potter?

278
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,638
No, not Harry Potter.

279
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,806
There are no movies in prison.

280
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,477
This is my point. You
guys got it soft and cushy.

281
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,730
This place is freaking awesome!
The people are awesome.

282
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,691
Your boss is nice.
Everybody seems to get along.

283
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,067
People are tolerant.

284
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,947
People who would jump to
conclusions can redeem themselves.

285
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,658
Nobody is nobody's bitch.

286
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,746
I hope that this scared you,
and from me, Prison Mike to you,

287
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:42,329
I just wanna thank you for listening to me
and letting me be a part of your life today.

288
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:48,752
"Cause you got a good life!
You got a good life, a good life.

289
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:01,394
So what do you think? It
doesn't sound so great, does it?

290
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,690
Wow. Thank you.

291
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,195
That must have been hard for
you to relive that. Both of you.

292
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:14,903
Yeah, that wasn't really
at all my experience.

293
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,453
There's certain elements
of what you performed

294
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,496
I've seen on television,

295
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,000
but it didn't remind me
of my time in prison.

296
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,421
Okay. Okay, fine.

297
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:32,967
You guys think prison
is so great. All right.

298
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,388
Well, here you go.

299
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:38,264
Okay, Michael,
come on, let us out.

300
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,310
No! If you think prison is so
wonderful, then enjoy prison.

301
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,146
Are we gonna...
They are such babies.

302
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,273
I am going
to leave them in there

303
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,985
until they can appreciate
what it's like to have freedom.

304
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,781
And if this doesn't bother
them, then I am out of ideas.

305
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,913
Hey,
let us out of here.

306
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,500
Hey! I have...
Shh.

307
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,716
This is Toby.

308
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
Hey, Pam.

309
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,429
Where're you calling from?

310
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:23,184
Michael, why is everyone
locked in the conference room?

311
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,354
They were very disrespectful
to me and to the office

312
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,607
and Martin has had
a bad influence.

313
00:18:29,774 --> 00:18:33,444
To think that I gave him
the benefit of the doubt. It's...

314
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,949
Well, you're gonna have to
let them out, or I will, okay?

315
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:42,287
You know what, Toby? I am
teaching them a lesson, so...

316
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,457
You know they're teasing you.

317
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,290
I mean, obviously this is a much
nicer place than an actual prison.

318
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,674
We get paid to be here.

319
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,968
We go home afterwards
and have social lives.

320
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,138
And we have parties here.

321
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,060
They're teasing you
to be funny.

322
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,988
Okay, nutcases,
get out of there.

323
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:21,864
Good work. Long day. Really long.
Why don't you guys head home early.

324
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,664
Time off for good behavior!

325
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,670
Good job. Enjoy your freedoms.

326
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:42,388
Martin went from being
a new guy from Stamford

327
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:47,097
to the convict, to my friend,
back to a convict,

328
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:54,188
then to kind of a nuisance, actually,
if we could be completely honest,

329
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:59,359
and finally, to a quitter.
And I will not miss him.

330
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:05,744
And that is not because
he is black.

331
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,873
So we've
been told and some choose to believe it

332
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,420
But I know they're wrong
wait and see

333
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,553
'Cause one day we'll find it

334
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:24,472
The ainbow-ray anection-cay

335
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,893
The lovers,
the dreamers and me!
