1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,880
Okay, where does it hurt?

2
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:08,006
Just... All over.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,468
I don't want to do anything.
I'm dying.

4
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:12,553
No, that's not how it works.

5
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,847
You have to point to a
specific part of the body.

6
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:17,057
Right there.

7
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,893
Abdomen.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,020
Menses.
Maybe.

9
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:23,230
"The uterus contracts after
your egg passes through it."

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,815
Not it, I don't have eggs.

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,525
So when did this start?

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,444
About 10 minutes ago.
I don't...

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
When I came in
with the paperwork?

14
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,864
About 40 times a year,

15
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,367
Michael gets really sick
but has no symptoms.

16
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,203
Dwight is always
gravely concerned.

17
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:41,164
Is it possible you ate
food that contained animal waste?

18
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,958
It's possible.

19
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,251
Michael?

20
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,128
David Wallace is on line one.

21
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,296
CFO?

22
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,299
All right, everybody out.
Out, out, out.

23
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,718
Okay.

24
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,387
To what do I owe this
great honor, David Wallace?

25
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:58,056
Michael, I am
calling to see... And Gromit.

26
00:01:00,142 --> 00:01:03,019
Jan? Is Jan there?

27
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:06,523
Jan is out of town right now.
Oh. You sigh like Jan.

28
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,071
I broke Jan's heart, David.
And I feel awful. It was...

29
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:16,867
It was never my intention to
ruin a life. But you know what?

30
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,870
Sometimes...
Michael?

31
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,581
...you just gots to get
your freak on. Michael?

32
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,333
Yeah?
Michael?

33
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,502
I am calling to see
if you would come down

34
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:31,173
and interview for a job we
have opening up in corporate.

35
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:33,675
Really?
A week from today.

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,010
Bring your first quarter stats

37
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,138
and your recommendation for
who'd take over the Scranton branch.

38
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:39,431
Wow.

39
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,893
I wish I had prepared
something to say.

40
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,356
That's not necessary. May
God guide you in your quest.

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,234
Yes.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,353
Okay. Everybody have
their towels and swimsuits?

43
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,315
We've got an hour and a half. I
suggest that you all go potty now,

44
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,485
and then we will be
congregating on the party bus.

45
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,445
Oh, I'm excited.
Today is Beach Day.

46
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,822
Michael is taking the
whole office to the beach.

47
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,951
So I'm wearing my bathing suit
underneath my shirt.

48
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,495
Oh, yeah.
I packed it in my purse.

49
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,749
Oscar, you brought
your Speedo, I assume?

50
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:48,208
I don't wear a Speedo,
Michael.

51
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:51,003
Well, you can't swim
in leather pants.

52
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:54,798
I'm just yanking your chain.

53
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,383
Not literally.

54
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,969
Anybody need sun block?
I've got SPF 30.

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,765
Oh. You know what?
You're not going.

56
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,684
It's Beach Day.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

57
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,144
Toby, we...

58
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,313
Somebody has to stay here.

59
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,897
I want today to be a beautiful
memory that the staff and I share

60
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,571
after I have passed on
to New York.

61
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:22,659
And if Toby's a part of it,
then it'll suck.

62
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,413
Hey. You want my sunscreen?

63
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,165
Oh, great.

64
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,335
I forgot mine
and I'm wearing a two-piece.

65
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,545
Thanks, Toby.

66
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,260
Hey, Pam. I have a very
important job for you today.

67
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:42,137
I thought we were just
having fun at the beach.

68
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:46,183
We are. We are. But I
would like you to take notes.

69
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:49,019
And I want you to find out
about people's character.

70
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,064
You know,
not their hotness, per se,

71
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,359
but their humor
and their charisma,

72
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:59,943
and the indefinable quality that
makes you all glad to follow me.

73
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,200
What happens to a company
if somebody takes a boss away?

74
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,453
I will answer your question
with a question.

75
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:11,037
It's like what happens to a chicken
when you take its head away.

76
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,668
It dies.

77
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:17,130
Unless you find a new head.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,340
I need to see which one of these people
have the skills to be a chicken head.

79
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,099
You want me to write down
people's indefinable qualities?

80
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,227
I want you to write down everything
that people are doing all day

81
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,856
and then type it up in a
way that is helpful. All right?

82
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,692
I have the most boring job
in the office.

83
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,780
So why wouldn't I have the
most boring job on Beach Day?

84
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,658
This way to the party bus.

85
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,869
I just want to lie on the
beach and eat hot dogs.

86
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,456
That's all I've ever wanted.

87
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,166
And the night
got deathly quiet

88
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,503
And his face lost
all expression

89
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,715
Said, "If you're gonna
play the game, boy

90
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,927
"You gotta learn
to play it right

91
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,555
"You got to know
when to hold 'em

92
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,475
"Know when to fold 'em"”

93
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:10,559
Yeah.

94
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,730
"Know when to walk away
Know when to run

95
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,483
"You never count your money

96
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,861
"When you're sitting
at the table

97
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:26,408
"There'll be time enough
for counting

98
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,870
"When the dealing's done”

99
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:33,665
Everybody, may I have
your attention, please?

100
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:38,666
Today, we are not just
spending a day at the beach.

101
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,672
Oh, sweet mother of God.

102
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,924
If you don't like it, Stanley, you
can go to the back of the bus.

103
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:47,429
Excuse me? Or the front
of the bus or drive the bus.

104
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,681
Just...

105
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:54,265
We are all participating
in mandatory fun activities.

106
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,147
Funtivities.

107
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,359
And there is a special
secret prize for the winner.

108
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:01,609
Yes! Funtivities!

109
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,153
I knew it wasn't just
a trip to the beach.

110
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:06,698
Okay, you know what? Your
enthusiasm's turning people off.

111
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,201
I hope there will be
management parables. Well...

112
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,414
Hey, Pam. Did you get
that down? Like what?

113
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:16,333
Like everything I said and
everything they did, and just...

114
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,752
I don't know exactly... Don't...
Write it down before you forget it.

115
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,339
That's... You've just been
drawing pictures.

116
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,551
I can't stay mad at you.

117
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,720
Here we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

118
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:32,557
Everybody ready?
Last one down is a rotten egg.

119
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,851
Watch out for snakes.

120
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,522
Everybody, put on sunscreen.

121
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,526
All right. Find a cozy spot.
Everybody, settle in.

122
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,535
Okay, everybody up.
Circle around.

123
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,329
Let us play some games.

124
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:59,627
We are situated on the northeast
corner of scenic Lake Scranton,

125
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,922
America's eighth-largest
indigenous body of water.

126
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,507
It is here that a group of Americans
will undergo the ultimate challenge.

127
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,641
One day, fourteen
strangers who work together,

128
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,977
but only one survivor.
What?

129
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:21,689
Just words. Inspiring words.
Not a contender.

130
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,402
For the competitions, you
will be divided into four tribes.

131
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,196
Each tribe will have a leader

132
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,865
that I will pick randomly off the
top of my head without thinking.

133
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,910
Jim, Dwight,
Andy, and Stanley.

134
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,662
Choose your tribes.
Yes!

135
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,706
Except for Pam, not Pam.

136
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,626
Jim Halpert.
Karen.

137
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:45,209
Pros: Smart,
cool, good-looking.

138
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,841
Remind you of anybody
you know?

139
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,762
Cons: Not a hard worker.

140
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,055
I can spend all day
on a project,

141
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,975
and he will finish the
same project in half an hour.

142
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,602
So that should
tell you something.

143
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,312
I choose Michael!

144
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,898
I'm not playing.

145
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,775
Okay. Temp.

146
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,153
Dwight is an obvious candidate
for my job.

147
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:12,573
He has the best sales record
in the office. He loves the work.

148
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,244
He is, however, an idiot.

149
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:18,455
We are going to choose
team names. Dwight.

150
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,750
We will be called Gryffindor.
Really? Not Slytherin?

151
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,043
Slytherin are
the bad guys, Jim.

152
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,505
I know.
Okay, we will be Voldemort.

153
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,008
He Who Must Not Be Named?
I wouldn't do that.

154
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,511
Voldemort. Voldemort.
Okay, seriously...

155
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,013
Voldemort. Voldemort.
...you really shouldn't be saying...

156
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,390
Voldemort. Voldemort.
Idiots. Idiots.

157
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,893
Okay, okay. Stanley,
your team name?

158
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,728
I don't care
what you call my team.

159
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,105
Then I will name your team
the Red Team.

160
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,857
No, the Blue Team.

161
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:50,691
I am also considering Stanley
because of all the good

162
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:54,074
that black people have done
for America.

163
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,659
We will be Team USA.

164
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,080
Very good. Pam, please, take
a note that Andy is patriotic.

165
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:05,209
Andy Bernard.
Pros: He's classy, he gets me.

166
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,839
He went to Cornell.
I trust him.

167
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:12,676
Cons: I don't really
trust him.

168
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:17,180
It is time for the great spoon and
egg race. This one is with a little twist.

169
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:20,934
There's already a twist, you're
carrying an egg on a spoon.

170
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,562
The person carrying the egg
will be blindfolded.

171
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,021
Please, put on
your blindfolds.

172
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:28,024
That person carrying the egg
will go down, circle a torch,

173
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:30,944
come back,
deposit their egg in the pail.

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,820
First team back is the winner.
All right, ready, set, go!

175
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:38,660
Come on, Phyllis,
you can do it.

176
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,704
Thank you so much.

177
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,290
Phyllis is out. Yes! Follow
my voice. Follow my voice.

178
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:46,542
Yeah, keep it moving,
keep it moving right this way.

179
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,503
Looking good. KELLY: I
don't want to hit the big rock.

180
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:49,629
Don't worry, you're not...

181
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,215
I know I'm near the big rock, I just
know it. Nowhere near the big rock.

182
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,341
Andy, I don't wanna get hurt
by the big rock.

183
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,093
What are you doing? No!

184
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,764
See, now we're disqualified.

185
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:03,472
I am okay if I lose
every single contest today.

186
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,062
Honestly.

187
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:09,440
Because I see these contests

188
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,487
as an opportunity for me to
demonstrate what a good sport I am.

189
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,821
Mallard.

190
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,367
Stop, stop, stop. There's
a hole. - Move it!

191
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,451
- Just step over the hole.
- Move your ass!

192
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,538
Come on, lazy-bones!
Move it! Come on! Yup.

193
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:24,873
Perfect. Just made it.
Okay, turn left. Come on!

194
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,375
Come on! Andale,
Andale! Arriba!

195
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,668
You have to stop this right now
or I'm not gonna do this anymore.

196
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,170
What are you saying?
You have to stop yelling at me

197
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,338
or I'm not gonna do
the egg race.

198
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:32,463
Okay, I apologize
for yelling at you.

199
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,549
That's what being
a good captain is about.

200
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,633
I'm trying
to bring team spirit!

201
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,925
It's about listening
to your team.

202
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,677
Whoa, stop. Another hole.
Take a big step.

203
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:39,137
I am not hysterical.
I am explaining...

204
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,263
Yes!

205
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,641
Oh, my God. You ass.

206
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,395
There's nothing better than
a beautiful day at the beach,

207
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,979
filled with sun, surf
and diligent note-taking.

208
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,028
Pam,
you're missing things!

209
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,795
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Mush! Mush!

210
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,964
Come on, you bastard!
What the...

211
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,716
Damn it, temp!

212
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:21,054
Great job, everyone,
that was fantastic.

213
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,643
Okay, Pam, I have
another little project for you.

214
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,188
Does it have to do with these
shopping bags filled with hot dogs?

215
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,273
Smart as a whip! Yes.

216
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,650
These are pre-cooked, so
it's not absolutely necessary,

217
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,446
but I would appreciate it if
you could heat up 800 hot dogs

218
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,241
for a little contest I'm going to be
having. I would greatly appreciate it.

219
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,161
When's the contest?
Like, 10 minutes?

220
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,788
How am I supposed to get...
Thanks a bunch.

221
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:53,207
A good manager has got to
be hungry. Hungry for success.

222
00:11:53,962 --> 00:11:55,213
Okay, who's hungry?

223
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,757
No, no, no, do not touch
the food. Please, not yet.

224
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,885
That is our next event.
A hot dog-eating contest.

225
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:02,220
Oh, God.

226
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,471
For those of you
who are curious,

227
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:07,976
the world record
is 54 and one half hot dogs.

228
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,228
Wow. And you know what?

229
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,439
I personally have
cooked up enough

230
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,607
so that each and every one
of you could break that record.

231
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,360
So shoot for the stars,
okay? All right!

232
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,573
The team that eats the most hot dogs
in 10 minutes will be declared the winner!

233
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,617
On your mark, get set...

234
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,537
Can I have a turkey burger? No.
I have the only one. I claimed it.

235
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,372
Ready? OSCAR:
Turkey is a healthy meat.

236
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,707
Yeah,
it's very good for you.

237
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,918
I don't eat meat, Michael.
I'm not gonna eat this.

238
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,293
It has L-tryptophan.
Guys, guys.

239
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,629
- Come on...
- What's L-tryptophan?

240
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,130
Please! Let's just...

241
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,343
Okay, it's very important that you all
try to eat as many hot dogs as you can.

242
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:45,179
On your mark, get set, eat!

243
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,851
Is there any mustard? No
mustard! No mustard! Just eat it!

244
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:54,314
Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so
it'll slide down your gullet more easily.

245
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,108
Come on, the winner gets
a big, big prize. What is it?

246
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,944
I can't say. You can't say?
Or you can't pronounce it?

247
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:03,906
The winner gets regional manager
salary for a year and a Sebring

248
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,118
and the feeling that they're
making a difference in the world.

249
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:07,410
Can we just take
those first two things?

250
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:10,747
The winner of today
gets my job.

251
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,710
Okay? I'm interviewing
for a job at corporate.

252
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,505
And they're only interviewing
a handful of people,

253
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:22,466
and I'm the most qualified,
and I'll probably get it, all right?

254
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,304
You're leaving?
I didn't wanna tell anybody.

255
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,306
I didn't wanna cast a pall
over our fun Beach Day.

256
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,891
But you know what?
I don't know who to recommend,

257
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,268
because, frankly,
nobody's stepping up.

258
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,271
I am so hungry.

259
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,981
Do you expect me to believe

260
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:39,358
that you're truly making your
recommendations on this basis?

261
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,028
Word.

262
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,031
Here we go. Let's see it.

263
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,660
I would rather work for an upturned
broom with a bucket for a head

264
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:53,244
than work for somebody else in
this office besides myself. Game on.

265
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:57,877
Come on. Come on.
Four seconds. Three, two, one...

266
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,963
Stop your eating!

267
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,258
And the winner is Andy
Bernard... - Team USA!

268
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,010
...with 14 hot dogs!

269
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,678
One came up.

270
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,680
Thirteen hot dogs, everybody.

271
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,182
Damn it!

272
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,434
Nobody told me
we were gonna have hot dogs.

273
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,023
Sabotage.

274
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:22,610
What? What are you saying?
Did you say sandwich?

275
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:27,194
No. I was saying that before. Not
now. Now I am saying sabotage.

276
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:32,162
The ancient Dutch art of
screwing up your own team.

277
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,334
I knew you were saying sabotage.
I was giving you an example of it.

278
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:42,338
I will misunderstand everything
that Andy says until he goes insane.

279
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,633
If Michael organizes
some kind of group hug,

280
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:46,968
stand next to me.

281
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,514
It's very simple.
There are only three rules.

282
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,556
You must not touch the ground.
You must not step outside of the ring.

283
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,189
And you must always
wear the safety mittens.

284
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,107
We don't have
any safety mittens.

285
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,110
Probably left them in the trunk of
my car. It's all right. Here we go.

286
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,570
Get him, big boy!

287
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,573
And go!

288
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,867
Come on, Jim! Come on!
What are you doing?

289
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,703
Come on!
Stop.

290
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,582
Nice, Stanley!

291
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,500
Sorry about that.

292
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,419
It's all about taking points
away from Dwight.

293
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,713
Yeah. No. Good. Okay.

294
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,590
Oh, my God.

295
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,594
I have never seen that look
in a man's eyes, ever.

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,557
I thought that I might die.
On Beach Day.

297
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,272
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

298
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,274
If either of these guys
are put in charge of the office,

299
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,567
I will transfer to Albany.

300
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,818
Gil can come if he wants.

301
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:48,863
I'm kind of looking for a way
out of that relationship, anyway.

302
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:53,822
I think I might try girls for a while.
Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.

303
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,830
One, two, three!

304
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,749
Yeah! Yeah!

305
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,167
Excellent!

306
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,503
- Gryffindor!
- Gryffindor!

307
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,629
Come on!

308
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,589
I didn't win.

309
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,968
But the only reason I didn't
win is because I recently learned

310
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:12,303
that it's better
to work things out with words.

311
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,305
That's not why you lost.

312
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,557
Yeah, it is. I totally could
have kicked your butt.

313
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,060
Oh, yeah, right.
Yeah, right.

314
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,856
Yeah, right! Come on, come on!
God!

315
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,985
How do you like that?

316
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:46,087
<i>Help. Help!
Angela! Angela, hey.</i>

317
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,423
Oh, thank God.
Go tell somebody.

318
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,842
What, Andy?
Andy, what should I tell them?

319
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,429
Go tell them
I'm floating away, obviously.

320
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,848
I don't understand
what you want from me.

321
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,391
Angela, it's pretty simple.

322
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:01,936
Look at what I'm doing
and go tell somebody it!

323
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:03,563
Sorry!

324
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:06,691
Bye, Andy!

325
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,984
Angela!

326
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,820
I knew that finding a
successor would be difficult.

327
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,740
I did not know that
it would be impossible.

328
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,493
Thus far the candidates
have been wildly disappointing.

329
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,373
Jim is not taking it seriously.
Stanley is having a stroke.

330
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:24,292
And Andy, where is he?
Where the hell is Andy?

331
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,129
Where is he, Pam? Do you know?

332
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,091
Who's ahead in points?
I think they're even.

333
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,344
At various times
you gave Jim 10 points,

334
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:38,681
Dwight a gold star,
and Stanley a thumbs-up.

335
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,683
And I don't really know
how to compare those units.

336
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:43,686
Well, check to see if there is a
conversion chart in that notebook.

337
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,522
I really doubt it, Michael.
Please, just check.

338
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,567
Great. Yeah,
I'll see you next week.

339
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,987
Thank you. And here
is Karen Filippelli. Bye.

340
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:57,616
Hello? Yeah, hi, David.

341
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,579
Yes, I would like to be considered
for the corporate position in well.

342
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,373
"In well"?
As well.

343
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:05,833
How would that work, in well?

344
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,711
I just want to know.
Yes.

345
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,253
Wait a minute.

346
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,173
That would be fine. If this
job is in a well, I don't want it.

347
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,508
I don't.

348
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:17,512
What does a great manager need
most of all?

349
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,765
Courage.
How so?

350
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:24,310
I mean, sure thing.
That sounds smart.

351
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,355
I can't do this anymore.
I'm going to sit in the bus.

352
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,941
Your loss, Stanley.

353
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,194
Meanwhile, the rest of us
will have a super-fun time

354
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,823
defeating our fear
and creating a lasting memory

355
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:41,327
walking through fire!

356
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,669
Who among you has
the guts to replace me?

357
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,714
Let him walk
across these coals.

358
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,845
Are you gonna try it?

359
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm not gonna walk in the fire after
your disgusting feet have gone through.

360
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,809
Angela, it is
a million degrees.

361
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,229
I'm gonna do it.

362
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,232
And I fully expect to burn
my feet and go to the hospital.

363
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,612
That's the right spirit
when doing a coal walk, right?

364
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,906
No, no. Not you, Pam.
You have to keep score.

365
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,533
I'd like to try it.
Pointless.

366
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,118
But I'm not kidding,
I really wanna do it.

367
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,412
Okay? This is about guts.

368
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,999
It takes guts to be
a regional manager.

369
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,375
Jim, you're up.

370
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
Nope.
Why not? Come on.

371
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,715
Oh, 'cause I don't want
my feet to get burned.

372
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,887
You do not have what it takes
to be a regional manager.

373
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,221
That's harsh.

374
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:46,805
Who's next? Andy, where is
Andy? Andy is never here today.

375
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,440
Hello? Who's there?

376
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,235
My name is Andrew Bernard, I was
with a group called Dunder Mifflin.

377
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:00,907
Hello?

378
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,534
Why don't you go, Michael?

379
00:20:03,618 --> 00:20:07,788
Because I already did.
Remember? I burned my foot

380
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,832
on the George Foreman Grill.

381
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,418
That is not the same at all.

382
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,129
If you're gonna ask other people
to do it, you should do it yourself.

383
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,381
All right, okay.
All right. Fine.

384
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,511
Okay.

385
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,682
Okay.

386
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:31,646
Go.

387
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:40,108
The mind has to wrap
around the foot.

388
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,215
Okay.

389
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,348
You want us to count to three?

390
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,933
Yes, count to three, please.

391
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,602
- Three, two, one!
- Three, two, one!

392
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:12,812
Count the other way.
Go.

393
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,230
No, no. Count one, two, three.

394
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,024
Okay, okay.
Not three, two, one.

395
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:18,984
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

396
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,695
- Go! Do it!
- Go, Michael.

397
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,114
Wait. Am I going on "go"
or am I going on "three"?

398
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,283
On "three". DWIGHT:
On the "go" that's after "three".

399
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,367
Okay.

400
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,204
- One, two, three, go!
- One, two, three, go!

401
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,757
No! It's okay.
I will do this, Michael.

402
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,844
Don't, Dwight... I will walk
and stand on these coals

403
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:49,140
until you award me the
position of regional manager!

404
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,060
Wow.
Yes.

405
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,355
- Dwight.
- Dwight. Dwight.

406
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:57,898
Keep moving
if you're gonna walk there.

407
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,108
Keep moving!

408
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,068
Keep coming.
Give me the job!

409
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,695
That's enough!
Give me the job!

410
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,781
I'm not going
to give it to you!

411
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,907
Don't kneel on the coals!

412
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:08,200
Oh, my God!

413
00:22:08,284 --> 00:22:10,035
Michael, do something!

414
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,204
God, that stinks!

415
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,206
Dwight, stop it!

416
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,417
Being a boss
is also about image.

417
00:22:17,752 --> 00:22:22,006
I've never looked like that.
That was gross.

418
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:27,549
I just... I don't see the connection
between a fire walk and management.

419
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,056
Worst $75 I ever spent.

420
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:34,434
You know what? If I had to pick
my replacement based on today,

421
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,188
it would be Mr. Outside Hire.

422
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,065
Or Mrs. Outside Hire.

423
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,775
Yeah. True.

424
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:43,694
Look, I don't...

425
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:48,282
I don't wanna leave this branch
that I love to an outside hire.

426
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:52,949
Therefore, we're going to have
a 100-point, winner-take-all,

427
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,291
sudden death,
Tribal Council round

428
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,252
to test the aspect of my job

429
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:04,836
that I think is the most important,
something I call the Bob Hope factor.

430
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,968
Who's Bob Hope?

431
00:23:07,051 --> 00:23:10,012
God. He's... He's a comedian.

432
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:12,890
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Who's Amanda Bynes?

433
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:16,435
She's from What a Girl Wants.
Oh, I love that movie.

434
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,978
Yes. Kelly is right.

435
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:22,562
The person to replace me has
to have a great sense of humor.

436
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,444
And they have to possess

437
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:28,739
the leadership qualities
of a Bynes or a Hope.

438
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:38,540
So, without further ado,
Jim and Dwight.

439
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,670
Show us what you've got.

440
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:48,296
Hey. I know what you're
looking for, but I gotta be honest,

441
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,305
I really don't think I should be
considered as your replacement.

442
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,348
You are being too modest.

443
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:57,601
Michael, on Thursday, I'm gonna
drive down and interview with David

444
00:23:57,685 --> 00:23:59,311
for the open position
in New York.

445
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:04,900
Okay, that is not funny.

446
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:10,197
I am deducting 60 points
from Voldemort

447
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:12,032
for false pretenses.

448
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,701
Okay, Dwight, your turn.
Wow us.

449
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,496
The Aristocrats.

450
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,001
A man and his wife and children
go into the offices of a talent agency.

451
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,385
And the talent agent says,
"Describe your act."

452
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:36,094
And the man says something
really, really raunchy.

453
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:40,769
And the talent representative
says, "What do you call yourselves?"

454
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:43,313
And the man says,
"The Aristocrats."

455
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:55,868
I mean,
truly repulsive acts.

456
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,371
That is a very,
very funny story.

457
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,248
Hey. I wanna say something.

458
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,045
I've been trying to be more honest lately,
and I just need to say a few things.

459
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,965
I did the coal walk.
Just... I did it.

460
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,220
Michael, you couldn't even do
that. Maybe I should be your boss.

461
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,141
Wow, I feel really good
right now.

462
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:22,144
Why didn't any of you
come to my art show?

463
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,857
I invited all of you.
That really sucked.

464
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:31,069
It's like sometimes some of
you act like I don't even exist.

465
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,243
Jim, I called off
my wedding because of you.

466
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:39,578
And now.
we're not even friends.

467
00:25:40,913 --> 00:25:44,666
And things are just, like, weird
between us, and that sucks.

468
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,502
And I miss you.

469
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:50,213
You were my best friend
before you went to Stamford.

470
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,758
And I really miss you.

471
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,177
I shouldn't have been
with Roy.

472
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,807
And there were a lot of
reasons to call off my wedding.

473
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:02,601
But the truth is, I didn't care
about any of those reasons

474
00:26:02,685 --> 00:26:03,686
until I met you.

475
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,106
And now you're with
someone else. And that's fine.

476
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:10,275
It's... Whatever.
That's not what I'm...

477
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,861
I'm not...
Okay, my feet really hurt.

478
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,781
The thing that I'm just
trying to say to you, Jim,

479
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:17,950
and to everyone else
in the circle, I guess,

480
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,078
is that I miss having fun
with you.

481
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:25,582
Just you, not everyone
in the circle.

482
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,173
Okay, I am gonna go walk
in the water now.

483
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,218
Yeah. It's a good day.

484
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,766
Pam! That was amazing!

485
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,811
But I am still looking for
someone with a sales background.

486
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,318
Flintstones.
Meet the Flintstones

487
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,654
They're a modern stone age
family

488
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,991
From the town of Bedrock

489
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,786
They're a page
right out of history

490
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:06,248
Let's ride with the family
down the street

491
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:09,501
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

492
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,213
When you're
with the Flintstones

493
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,673
You'll have
a yabba dabba doo time

494
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:16,341
A dabba doo time

495
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,886
You'll have a gay, old time!

496
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,806
Wilma!

497
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,265
Nice.
