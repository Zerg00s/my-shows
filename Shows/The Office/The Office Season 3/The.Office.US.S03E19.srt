1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,671
Good morning, Pam.

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,548
Oh, welcome back, Andy.

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,884
Drew. I'm Drew now.

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,636
Oh, Drew. Sorry.

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:15,139
Apology not accepted.

6
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,768
Because it wasn't even
necessary in the first place.

7
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:23,939
Several weeks ago, Andy
Bernard had an incident.

8
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,653
But after five weeks
in anger management,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,865
I'm back, and I've got
a new attitude and a new name

10
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:37,286
and a bunch of
new techniques

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,913
for dealing
with the grumpies.

12
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,622
Morning, Jim,

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,917
Hey, Andy.
How are you, man?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,418
Good. Drew.

15
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,544
What's that?

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,212
You can call me Drew.

17
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:49,131
No, I'm not gonna
call you that.

18
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,966
Cool.

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,845
I can't control what you do.
I can only control what I do.

20
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:55,930
Andy.

21
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,097
Drew.

22
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,601
Dwight.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,771
How's it going, man?

24
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,901
Yes. I have decided to shun Andy
Bernard for the next three years.

25
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,820
Which I'm looking forward to.

26
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,779
It's an Amish technique.

27
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:15,073
It's like slapping
someone with silence.

28
00:01:15,157 --> 00:01:17,951
I was shunned from the age
of four until my sixth birthday

29
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,662
for not saving the excess oil
from a can of tuna.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,791
Jim, could you please
inform Andy Bernard

31
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:25,667
that he is being shunned?

32
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,671
Andy, Dwight says welcome
back and that he could use a hug.

33
00:01:30,172 --> 00:01:32,048
Okay. Tell him
that that's not true.

34
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,717
Dwight says that
he actually doesn't know

35
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,302
one single fact
about bear attacks.

36
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,387
Okay. No, Jim.
You guys.

37
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,056
Tell him that bears can
climb faster than they can run.

38
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,101
Jim, tell him!

39
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,812
Andy... No, it's too far.

40
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,480
Damn you.

41
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,796
Today is
safety training day.

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,507
Toby is leading
ours upstairs.

43
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,053
But I am giving everyone
a little bit of a treat.

44
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:21,348
We are going to listen in on Darryl's
presentation at the warehouse.

45
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,476
And if I know Darryl,
it gonna to be zoppity.

46
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,269
Now,

47
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,231
this is the forklift.

48
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,194
You need a license
to operate this machine.

49
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:36,530
That means the upstairs
office workers can't drive it.

50
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,407
Quiz. Mike.

51
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,950
Should you
drive the forklift?

52
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,076
I can and I have.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,870
No, no, no!
I said, "Should you?"

54
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,496
You should not drive it.

55
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,207
You should not
drive the forklift.

56
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,958
You understand? You're
not allowed to drive the forklift.

57
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,626
It's not safe.
You don't have a license.

58
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,337
Guys, I'm not the only one
who's driven the forklift.

59
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,630
Pudge has
driven the forklift.

60
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:55,048
Madge.

61
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:56,424
I thought your name
was Pudge.

62
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,385
No.
It's always been Madge.

63
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,720
Okay.

64
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,054
Her.

65
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:05,638
Her? Yes, "Her" is qualified to work
a dangerous machine. You are not.

66
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,645
Okay?
Fine.

67
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,731
Do you understand that?
Yes.

68
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,902
We do safety training every
year or after an accident.

69
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,529
We've never made it
a full year.

70
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:19,614
This particular time,
I was reaching

71
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,867
for a supply box
on the top shelf

72
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:26,163
when one office worker,
who shall remain nameless,

73
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,249
kicked the ladder out
from under me and yelled...

74
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,168
Hey, Darryl,
how's it hanging?

75
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,714
And I fell and
busted my ankle and...

76
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,300
I'm legitimately
scared for my workers.

77
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,762
The baler can
flatten a car engine.

78
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,180
It can cut off
your arm and crush

79
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,934
your entire body
without skipping a beat.

80
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,101
Yeah!

81
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,771
How many people a year
do you think get their arms

82
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,399
cut off in a baler?

83
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:54,858
Bale 'er?
I hardly know her.

84
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:56,485
Damn it, Michael,
pay attention, man.

85
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,320
Anybody want
to take a guess?

86
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,030
Five bucks says
it's over fifty.

87
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,615
You really want to bet?
Anybody?

88
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,368
Ever since March Madness
ended, I am so bored.

89
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,995
How many?
Okay. You're on.

90
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,913
Ten people. Michael.

91
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,206
Ten people.

92
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,916
Would you like
to be one of them?

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,751
No, don't worry about it.
We'll just go double or nothing.

94
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,961
On what?

95
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,128
I don't know.
I'll figure something out.

96
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:16,504
Nice. What are you
guys talking about?

97
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,674
These are very
dangerous machines

98
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,177
down here and
the upstairs workers...

99
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,636
Michael?

100
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,638
...should not go
anywhere near them.

101
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,931
Yes. Yes.

102
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,683
But it wouldn't be the
worst thing in the world...

103
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,685
It would be the worst thing
in the world. It would.

104
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,103
What the hell is wrong
with this man? Very much so.

105
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,521
It's a big red
trash compactor.

106
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,897
It's not a trash compactor!

107
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:34,982
It's very dangerous, okay.

108
00:04:35,065 --> 00:04:36,232
Don't disrespect a baler,
Mike.

109
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,319
All right, all right,
I got it! I got it!

110
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:39,945
Only on the rarest of
occasions would I go near...

111
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,114
No, you don't touch it!
There is no occasion

112
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,283
for you to go near
this stuff, okay?

113
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,743
Toby now has the floor

114
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,537
and he is going to
try not to screw this up

115
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,707
like everything
else in his life.

116
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,792
Let me rephrase that.

117
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,295
I believe that you
can do safety training

118
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,880
and make it sound
just as good as Darryl.

119
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,008
Here we go!

120
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,260
Okay, one thing
you're going to want to

121
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,138
look out for is
carpal tunnel syndrome.

122
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,307
It's recommended that
you take a 10-minute break

123
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,058
from typing every hour.

124
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,352
For your circulation,
you're going to

125
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,020
want to get up
out of your chairs

126
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:16,314
and move around for
about 10 minutes every hour.

127
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:20,276
Yes. Good. Fine.
Like stretching and...

128
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,239
Yeah, your computer screen
can be a big strain on your eyes,

129
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,823
so it's also recommended that you step
away for about 10 minutes every hour.

130
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,496
Wow? That is...
That time really adds up.

131
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,748
That's like a half an hour,
every hour?

132
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,001
Take them at the same time.

133
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,545
Okay. You know what? You're
making it sound kind of lame.

134
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,632
So skip ahead to
the really dangerous stuff.

135
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,927
Like sometimes computers
can explode, can they not?

136
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,596
No. No.

137
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,517
You always want to
keep a sweater or cardigan

138
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,476
of some sort
in case it gets drafty.

139
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,562
What about
a long-sleeved tee?

140
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,646
That will work.

141
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,605
- Long johns?
- A shawl?

142
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,191
You know,
anything that warms you.

143
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,151
Okay, you know what,
I think that everybody

144
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,028
is going to vomit
due to boredom.

145
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,280
Sorry. He is very lame.

146
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,534
Let's see.

147
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,203
Seasonal affective disorder.

148
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,163
A depression that
includes weight gain,

149
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,792
fatigue, irritability, brought
on by the low light of winter.

150
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,044
Thank God we only had
a baler to deal with.

151
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,712
Yeah, that dim light
is a bitch, ain't it?

152
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,963
Okay. Guys, you know what?

153
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,924
I didn't interrupt when you
were having your presentation.

154
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,719
Actually, you did.

155
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:28,053
Yes.

156
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,513
Okay. Let's do another one.

157
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,765
This is a good one.

158
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,685
A particular concern for
office workers

159
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:37,979
is a sedimentary lifestyle
which can contribute...

160
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,564
Sedentary.

161
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,569
Yes. Which can
contribute to heart disease.

162
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,905
Heart disease Kills
more people than balers.

163
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,449
That's called having
a fat butt, Michael.

164
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,284
No. No, it's sedentary.

165
00:06:51,368 --> 00:06:53,036
Yeah,
that's fat butt disease.

166
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,246
That's what you suffer from?

167
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,873
You have fat butt disease,
Michael?

168
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,958
Excuse me, sea monster, you
weigh like a thousand pounds.

169
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,084
Yeah?
Yeah.

170
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,086
I bet you'd like to swim with
this sea monster, wouldn't you?

171
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,254
Ryan!

172
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,505
Dude, please tell
your girl to shut up.

173
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,590
What?

174
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,049
Kelly, you've insulted
the gentleman.

175
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,134
Please apologize.

176
00:07:07,217 --> 00:07:08,218
Are you kidding me?

177
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,344
All right,
we out of here.

178
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,513
Darryl, I did not walk out
in the middle of yours, so...

179
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,390
Yeah, but ours was real,
Michael.

180
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,475
Yes.

181
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:16,017
That's what we've been
trying to tell you, Mike.

182
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,685
It's serious down there.

183
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,690
We do dangerous stuff, man.
This is shenanigans, foolishness.

184
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:23,316
Nerf ball.

185
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:26,236
You live a sweet
little nerfy life

186
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,363
sitting on your biscuit

187
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,157
never having to risk it.

188
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:33,535
Okay.

189
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,333
What?
So, Nerf isn't cool anymore?

190
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,753
Darryl thinks he's such a
man because he works in a warehouse.

191
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,004
Well, big deal!

192
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,133
I worked in a warehouse.
Men's Wearhouse.

193
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,134
I was a greeter.

194
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,428
I'd like to see
Darryl greet people.

195
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,014
He'd probably make
them feel like wimps.

196
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,516
Not me, I...

197
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,396
Hello, I'm Michael.
Welcome to Men's Wearhouse.

198
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,899
We have a special
on khaki pants today.

199
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,736
This is one example.

200
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:11,948
Ten.

201
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,451
Really? Ten?
That's your guess?

202
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,827
You're
a professional accountant.

203
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,537
There's, like,
10 green ones.

204
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:18,622
Forty-two.

205
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,748
I'm going to say 50.

206
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,458
Don't be that person.
51.

207
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,210
Oh, come on. That is lame.
It's a strategy.

208
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,253
It's called being smart.
Thank you.

209
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,338
Oh, jeez.

210
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,591
I don't know how the whole
betting thing started,

211
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,009
but it's fun.

212
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,177
Ten.
Ten's out.

213
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,388
Damn it!
Forty-seven, 48,

214
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,389
forty-nine. Jim wins.

215
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:37,515
That is not fair.

216
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,685
He has spent hours up here
at reception with you.

217
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,021
Hours and hours.

218
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,439
Okay. Okay.

219
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:45,774
No, constantly.
Like for years.

220
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,859
Okay.

221
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:50,111
Pam, depression is as
scary as a baler, right?

222
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,947
I don't
understand the question.

223
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,531
Working in an office can lead to
depression, which can lead to suicide.

224
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,205
I mean this is
really serious stuff.

225
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,623
Yeah.

226
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,960
Nobody commits suicide
because they work with a baler.

227
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,296
And yet those guys
are making fun of me,

228
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:08,546
calling me a Nerf.

229
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,631
That...

230
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,008
It's really hard to
demonstrate depression.

231
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,928
Their safety training
had visuals.

232
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,263
Yeah.

233
00:09:16,638 --> 00:09:19,682
You are so right.

234
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,520
They have visual aids
and all we had were the facts.

235
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,606
You don't go to
the science museum

236
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,774
and get handed
a pamphlet on electricity.

237
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:33,196
You go the science museum and
you put your hand on a metal ball

238
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,282
and your hair
sticks up straight.

239
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:36,908
And you know science.

240
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,160
So, you're okay?

241
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,662
Indubitably.

242
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,833
They used props,
they used visual aids

243
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:48,211
and they just made
us look like dopes.

244
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,006
Idiots!
God, what are we going to do?

245
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,466
I don't know. I don't know.

246
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:54,759
Because you know
what our killer is?

247
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,095
Depression.
Wolves.

248
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,513
Depression.

249
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,557
Visual aids.
Yes.

250
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,809
A quilt. A depression quilt.

251
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,688
No time to sew a quilt.

252
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:08,940
I got it.

253
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,902
Get me the number for
the Giant Big Box Toy Store.

254
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:18,366
You may be asking yourself

255
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,493
what am I doing
on a trampoline?

256
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:23,288
Well, I thought I'd
bounce here for a while,

257
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,166
relieve some stress
and then move on with my day.

258
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,418
Not. Here's a plan.

259
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,044
Dwight is going to gather

260
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,674
all of the officer workers
and all of the warehouse guys

261
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,050
and we're going to have
another safety seminar.

262
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,886
Only this time,
where's Michael?

263
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,389
Oh, my God,
he is on the roof.

264
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,265
And now I have
got their attention.

265
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:46,394
I tell them about the cold
hard facts of depression.

266
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:50,607
And then I say, "Hey,
you ever seen a suicide?"

267
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,817
And I jump.

268
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:55,278
And they freak out.
And they get to see

269
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,448
the dangers of depression
with their own eyes.

270
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,825
Nice side note,
they might think,

271
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,744
"Hey, I should have
been nicer to Michael."

272
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,038
But that's not
why I'm doing this.

273
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,623
Then I land on the trampoline,

274
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,208
take a couple
extra bounces for fun.

275
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,377
I climb off,
walk around the corner,

276
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,170
ta-freaking-da.

277
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,547
So then the next movie
moves to the top of the queue.

278
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,923
So number five
becomes number four,

279
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,342
number six
becomes number five,

280
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,886
number three becomes
number two, etcetera, etcetera.

281
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,388
And let's just say
that I just sent back

282
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,222
Love Actually,
which was awesome.

283
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,018
And they sent me Uptown
Girls, which is also awesome.

284
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,561
But guess what, now I want
to see Love Actually again,

285
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:29,896
but it's at
the bottom of the queue.

286
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,564
Oh, no, what do I do?

287
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:32,940
What I do is this.

288
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,735
I go online,
I go click, click, click

289
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,319
and I change
the order of the queue,

290
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,738
so that I can see Love
Actually as soon as I want to.

291
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,740
It's so easy, Ryan.

292
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:43,785
Do you really not
know how Netflix works?

293
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,912
I guess I forgot.

294
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,623
You're such a ditz.

295
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,293
Ryan, well done.
Two minutes, 42 seconds.

296
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,295
Additionally, Pam,
you win $10

297
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,381
because she said
"awesome" 12 times.

298
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,343
And Jim, you win $5 because she
mentioned six romantic comedies.

299
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,638
Okay, let's do this thing!
I'll go summon the troops!

300
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,974
Maybe we should
test this first.

301
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,852
Letterman style.
Throw a TV over or...

302
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,312
We measured it once.

303
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,106
Go buy some watermelons.

304
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,901
Seedless?

305
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,569
Just...

306
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,660
Creed is eating an apple.

307
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,537
I found a potato.

308
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,164
Hey, Creed.

309
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,458
Hey.

310
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,051
Yes!

311
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:42,176
Here you go.

312
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:43,428
What?

313
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,554
Nice!

314
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,558
I don't know this place
as well as I thought I did.

315
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,477
I'm getting cleaned out.

316
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,645
Ready?

317
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:53,312
Let's do it.
Drop that sucker.

318
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:55,857
Yeah! Bingo!

319
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,405
Deactivate the car alarm,
clean up the mess.

320
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:03,490
Okay.

321
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,408
Find out whose car that is.

322
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:07,994
If it's Stanley's, call the
offices of James P. Albini,

323
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,079
see If he handles
hate crimes.

324
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:10,163
Got it.

325
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,957
Also, take apart the
trampoline. Stick it in the baler.

326
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,332
We're not allowed
to use the baler.

327
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,002
Have Padge do it
or the sea monster.

328
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,170
I'm on it.

329
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:23,176
I'm temporarily
lifting the shun.

330
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,302
Thank you.

331
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,554
It means nothing. I need
you to do something for me.

332
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,764
Anything.

333
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,932
Okay, calm down.

334
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:33,145
I need you to acquire an
inflatable house and/or castle.

335
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,646
You mean a Moonbounce.

336
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,606
What do you think?
You've got an hour.

337
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,066
I'm going to need petty cash.

338
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,484
Shunning resumed.

339
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,529
Do you want a drawbridge?

340
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:43,904
Un-shun.

341
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,908
Yeah, that sounds good.
Re-shun.

342
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:52,288
Oh, yeah, this is much better.
It's safer.

343
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,790
Excellent decision.

344
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,959
Yes.
Thank you for seeing that.

345
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,628
When you land, try and
land like an eight-year-old.

346
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,880
These bouncy castles
are not designed for adults.

347
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:02,090
I don't know
if I want to do this.

348
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
Want to do another test?

349
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,425
I got plenty of
watermelons in my trunk.

350
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,760
No.

351
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,470
No more.
The tests are going terrible.

352
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:10,515
If we keep doing them, I'm
not going to want to jump.

353
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,475
This is about doing,
not thinking.

354
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,560
Right!

355
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:15,394
Doing!
Totally doing!

356
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,147
Let's rock and roll!
Rock and roll!

357
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,106
Yeah! That's right,
I'm not thinking!

358
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,152
Yes! Yeah!

359
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,903
Michael is awesome

360
00:14:23,987 --> 00:14:25,655
Jumping off the roof

361
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,532
Bouncing on a bouncy thing

362
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,159
Show them who is boss

363
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,202
Rip a hole in the sun!

364
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:33,246
I am ready to do this!

365
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,081
I'm ready to make a point!

366
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,668
Hey! Guys, listen up,

367
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:42,380
Michael is up on the roof
and acting strange.

368
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,425
What's the situation?

369
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,009
Un-shun. I think he's suffering
from depression. Re-shun.

370
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:51,639
Okay, when is the shunning
thing going to end?

371
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,975
Un-shun. Never. Re-shun.

372
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,393
I think he wants
you all to come out

373
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,520
to the parking lot
and watch him die.

374
00:14:58,313 --> 00:14:59,355
Is it nice outside?

375
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,815
It's gorgeous. Let's go!

376
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,025
Do I need my jacket?

377
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,235
No, it really is.
It's very nice.

378
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:04,569
Come on!

379
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,820
Will I be too warm
in a long-sleeved tee?

380
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,699
Everyone's going to be fine in
exactly what they're wearing! Let's go!

381
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:13,035
Let's go!

382
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:18,583
Come on! Hurry up, you guys!

383
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,751
My life!

384
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,712
Oh, my life!

385
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,090
Michael, what's wrong?

386
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,008
Everything's wrong.

387
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:29,677
The stress of
my modern office

388
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,138
has caused me to go
into a depression!

389
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:37,222
Depression? Isn't that just a
fancy word for feeling bummed out?

390
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,479
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

391
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,440
Depression is
a very serious illness.

392
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,066
Over 32,000 people
commit suicide every year

393
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:49,989
according to a 2004 study.

394
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:52,075
Is that the last year
the data was available?

395
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,201
Yes.

396
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,579
My head is in
such pain and turmoil.

397
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,665
Don't do anything rash.

398
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,833
Dwight,
where are the warehouse guys?

399
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:02,794
I didn't...

400
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,091
I didn't think you
needed them for this part.

401
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,010
Okay. That's...

402
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:11,094
You said to just...

403
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,179
That's the whole point,
dummy.

404
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,346
Okay. I'm on it.

405
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,848
Okay?

406
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,100
Attention,
blue-collar workers!

407
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,272
What are the odds that
this is in any way real?

408
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,066
I'd say, like, 10,000 to one.

409
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,735
Okay, I'd like 10
bucks on those odds.

410
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,070
If someone gives you 10,000
to one on anything, you take it.

411
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,161
If John Mellencamp
ever wins an Oscar,

412
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:41,457
I am going to be
a very rich dude.

413
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,712
Michael is up on the roof
and he's acting strange.

414
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,047
Oh, my life.

415
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,882
Michael, what's wrong?

416
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:52,051
Everything is wrong, Dwight.

417
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:56,014
The stress of my modern
office has made me depressed.

418
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:59,975
Depressed? Isn't that just a
fancy word for feeling bummed out?

419
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,644
Dwight, you ignorant slut!

420
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:04,313
Well, you know, the first
performance was a little off,

421
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:07,733
but I really think they hit
their stride in the second show.

422
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,571
I might even bring my parents
tomorrow to the matinee.

423
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,947
And that is why...

424
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,158
Oh, excuse me.
It's my favorite part.

425
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,451
...am going to
jump off this roof!

426
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,161
This is just offensive.

427
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,537
At least we're outside.

428
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,332
Hey, check it out,
there's a castle over there.

429
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,584
Oh, my God,
there is a castle.

430
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,670
No. There's nothing to
see over there, people.

431
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:29,464
There's nothing to see.

432
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,176
They found the castle,
Michael.

433
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,427
Damn it!

434
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:40,266
Oh, God. Oh, my God,
he's going to jump.

435
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,773
He's going to kill himself
pretending to kill himself.

436
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:48,023
Yeah.

437
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,234
Excuse me.

438
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,446
Hey, Michael,

439
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,824
don't jump on
the bouncy castle.

440
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:02,122
You can't do that 'cause you're
going to get horribly, horribly injured.

441
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,998
Hey, Michael,

442
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,253
I have a present for you but
you have to come down and get it.

443
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:10,880
What is it?

444
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,133
Come down
and open it and you'll see.

445
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,134
Dwight, find out
what the present is.

446
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,428
Okay, I don't see anything.

447
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:18,679
She might be bluffing.

448
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,139
Dwight.
Dwight.

449
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,686
It's a...

450
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,270
A Repliee-Q-One-Expo
female robot.

451
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,110
They're only
available in Japan.

452
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,527
Dwight, you are such a liar.

453
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,030
Pam, really what is it?

454
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,782
Mike, this is
the opposite of safety.

455
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,742
You jump, you're going to
seriously hurt yourself.

456
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:41,953
You told me
that I lead a...

457
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,332
A cushy, wimpy Nerf life.

458
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,917
Yeah.

459
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,712
But I never said you
had nothing to live for.

460
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,630
What do I have to live for?

461
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,590
A lot of things.

462
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,385
You...

463
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,853
What about Jan?

464
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,521
Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan,
man.

465
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,400
It's going good, right?

466
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,402
It's complicated with Jan.

467
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,490
And I don't know where
I stand or what I want.

468
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,076
The sex isn't nearly
as good as it used to be.

469
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,161
Mike,

470
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:25,955
you're a very brave man.

471
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,458
I mean it takes
courage just to be you.

472
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,794
To get out of bed
every single day,

473
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,131
knowing full well
you got to be you.

474
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,009
Do you really mean that?

475
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,469
I couldn't do it.

476
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,388
I ain't that strong
and I ain't that brave.

477
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,681
I'm braver than you?

478
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,057
Way braver.

479
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,101
You Braveheart, man.

480
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,606
I Braveheart.

481
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:54,734
I am.

482
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,153
Come on down, okay?

483
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,321
Okay.

484
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,116
Pam, I'm coming
down to get my present.

485
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,204
An office is
as safe as the people in it.

486
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:11,250
And sometimes those people can
drive you to do crazy things

487
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:15,379
to show
the dangers of the office.

488
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:18,090
That's the danger
I found myself in today.

489
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,426
I saved a life.

490
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:22,553
My own.

491
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,264
Am I a hero?

492
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,229
I really can't say, but yes.
