1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:04,045
Hello, Son.

2
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,631
If you're watching this,
that means I'm already dead.

3
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:09,884
Life is a... How do you
know it's gonna be a boy?

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,678
How... Would you stop
interrupting, please?

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,056
Yesterday,
I was scraping some gunk

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,225
off my wall sockets
with a metal fork

7
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,478
and I gave myself
the nastiest shock.

8
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:24,440
And when I came to,
I had an epiphery.

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,319
Life is precious.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:34,617
And if I die,
I want my son

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,164
to know the dealio.
The dealio of life.

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,708
Here are some things
that I want to teach you

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,460
that your mother
won't be able to.

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,630
To jump-start a car,
first, pop the hood.

15
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:53,427
Then you take these bad boys and
clip them anywhere on the engine.

16
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:58,182
Then, you take these
and clip them wherever.

17
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,896
Number eight, learn how
to take off a woman's bra.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,273
What...
We will demonstrate on Pam.

19
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,482
No.
And...

20
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,775
Come on.

21
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:13,823
You just twist your hand
until something breaks.

22
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,032
Ow!

23
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,702
Well, you get the picture.
Thanks, Pam.

24
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,081
And remember, no matter what,
I will always love you.

25
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:23,833
What if he's a murderer?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,710
He's not gonna be a murderer.

27
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:26,919
Maybe that's how you die?

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,298
You know what, Dwight,
do you want to do this or no?

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,466
I wanna do this.
Okay.

30
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,011
From the top. Ready? Three...

31
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,304
Action.

32
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,160
Hello, everyone.

33
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:03,831
As you know, we are six days
away from Phyllis' wedding.

34
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,127
So get your suits to the dry
cleaners and get your hair did.

35
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,546
And Karen,
you might wanna invest

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,507
in a dress or
a skirt of some kind

37
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,217
if you don't
already have one.

38
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,970
This may be
Phyllis' only wedding ever.

39
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:21,015
It's my job to insure that none
of you look like ragamuffins.

40
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:25,978
So I am
instituting prima nocta.

41
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,317
Prima nocta, I believe,
from the movie Braveheart

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,402
and confirmed on Wikipedia,

43
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,905
is when the king
got to deflower

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,491
every new bride on
her wedding night.

45
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,786
So...

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,666
I'm sorry, I had a very
different understanding

47
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,668
as to what prima nocta meant.

48
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,587
I'm trying to get everyone
excited about Phyllis' wedding

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,299
because I want her to get
people excited about my wedding

50
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,718
when the time comes,
which won't be hard,

51
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,303
because it's
gonna be awesome.

52
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,930
A lot better than hers,
that's for sure.

53
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:02,682
It'll probably be on a boat.

54
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,892
What's up, spinsters?

55
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,018
Nothing.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,812
You know,
this is a luncheon shower.

57
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,021
Girls only.

58
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,272
No problem.

59
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,359
The guys are having a little
shindig of their own

60
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:16,153
<i>in {he warehouse
from 2:30103:15.</i>

61
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,573
It is the only time
that Bob was available.

62
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,075
Sort of a guys' night out.

63
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:23,828
A G.N.O., if you will.
A gno.

64
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,831
Actually, it's more
of a guys' afternoon in.

65
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:29,417
A G.A.I. A gay.

66
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,463
Not... Not... It's
not gay. It's just a...

67
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:39,176
It's a bridal shower for guys.
A guy shower.

68
00:03:40,302 --> 00:03:42,555
An hour-long
shower with guys.

69
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,732
I guess Jim and I
have had a little bit

70
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,067
of a rough patch for
the past couple weeks,

71
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,528
but we had some
really good talks

72
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:01,073
and, actually now, I think
that we're better than ever.

73
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:06,162
Karen and I had
a long talk last night

74
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,039
and the night before that

75
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:15,463
and every night for
the last five nights.

76
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,728
Something's up
with Jim and Karen.

77
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:33,439
Not that I've
been eavesdropping.

78
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,649
It's not really
any of my business.

79
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:40,154
But I've gotten pretty good at
reading the back of Jim's neck.

80
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,573
Halpert!

81
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:45,242
Tall, queer,
handsome as ever.

82
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,787
"Hey, everybody,
it's me, Jim."

83
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello, hello.
Todd Packer.

84
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,461
Karen Filippelli,
Jim's girlfriend.

85
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,879
Shut up!

86
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:57,963
Shut it!

87
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,048
That's rude.

88
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:03,469
Either this chick is a dude
or Halpert got scared straight.

89
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,346
Yes! Yes!

90
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,641
There...

91
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,810
What happened? What?

92
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:11,894
Oh, God...

93
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,480
Quick! Somebody help!
Help the man!

94
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,607
No! No! No!

95
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,858
I can't believe
you're not gonna be there.

96
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,068
It's gonna be good.

97
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,071
It's gonna be a great
bachelor party, man.

98
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,405
I have a full day
of sales calls.

99
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,657
You should get out of them.

100
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,451
Oh, God.

101
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,953
It's the only time
he can do it.

102
00:05:29,328 --> 00:05:32,373
2:30 to 3:15.
It's gonna be great.

103
00:05:32,456 --> 00:05:33,916
We're going to be
doing some darts,

104
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:35,960
we're gonna be
grilling up some steaks.

105
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,714
Got some pie,
going to be very delicious.

106
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,467
And what kind of
stripper did you get?

107
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,554
I did not order a stripper.

108
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,972
What do you mean you
didn't order a stripper?

109
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,056
No...

110
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,016
You ever even been
to a bachelor party?

111
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,774
Not personally, no.

112
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,236
Mike, okay. A stripper
is Bachelor Party 101.

113
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,362
I... I...

114
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:05,447
If you don't get a stripper,
your party's gonna suck.

115
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,074
I can't get a stripper here.

116
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:08,617
Sexual harassment.

117
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,997
Get one for the girls, too.
That evens it out.

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,915
Like, you know,
separate but equal.

119
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,834
So that's what that means.

120
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:19,169
Okay, everybody,
a slight change of plans.

121
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,213
We are still going to
be having two parties,

122
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,842
but each is going to get a
little extra dose of naughty.

123
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:27,303
All right!

124
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,597
Okay.
What?

125
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,392
Okay, co-ed naked strippers
in this office, for realsies.

126
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,977
Under no circumstance
should a man

127
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,896
strip off his clothes
in this office.

128
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,148
Shut up, Angela!

129
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:45,487
Hey.

130
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,572
Hey!

131
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,163
Everything okay?

132
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,165
Oh, yeah. Why?

133
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,501
Well,
you seem a little tired.

134
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,257
Yeah, well, I guess there's
been a couple of late nights.

135
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,510
Karen and I have
been up talking.

136
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,641
You should get more sleep.

137
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,726
Yeah, I know I should.

138
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,729
Never underestimate the power
of a good night's sleep.

139
00:07:18,812 --> 00:07:19,939
No, I'm sure you're right.

140
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,442
When I get eight hours
compared to like, six hours,

141
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,402
it's like, big difference.

142
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,612
Really?

143
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:27,696
Oh, yeah.

144
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,824
You've got to
get your REM cycle

145
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:36,413
going with the whole
sleeping better than not.

146
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:40,668
Good advice, Beesly.
Thanks.

147
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,836
See you out there?
Yeah.

148
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,465
Don't fall asleep
at your desk!

149
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,800
Oh, my God.

150
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,552
Okay. We are off.

151
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,222
Ryan and I are going
to go get some supplies

152
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:58,519
and I need you to handle
hiring the strippers.

153
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,396
Absolutely not.
I'm on it.

154
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,898
Well, get on it
and make it happen.

155
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,986
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves,
no tats, no moles.

156
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,113
No tats.

157
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:10,823
No, tats.
Of course, I want...

158
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:13,075
Stop. That's disgusting.

159
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:15,077
Leave me alone and get
the male stripper. Fine.

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,370
I knew you would, Nancy.

161
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,538
Sally.

162
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,873
No preference.

163
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,959
What do you think,
redhead or brunette?

164
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,461
Blonde.

165
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:25,796
Nice.

166
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,591
Do you have any blonde women?

167
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,433
He hasn't even
said a word yet.

168
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,976
Just giggling.

169
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,815
Got you. Got... Whoa!

170
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,197
Yes?

171
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,782
Are you okay?

172
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,576
I'm in...
I'm in the sex shop.

173
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,827
Got you.

174
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:58,620
Okay, so they
have Albert Einstein,

175
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,415
Ben Franklin or
SpongeBob SquarePants.

176
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,083
SquarePants?

177
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,543
Yep, SpongeBob SquarePants.

178
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,712
And you think
that'd be sexy?

179
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:11,216
Michael referred me to a male
strip club called Banana Slings.

180
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:15,846
Instead, I called the Scholastic
Speakers of Pennsylvania.

181
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,640
Hold the door, please!

182
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,642
Thank you.

183
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,269
Hello.
Hello.

184
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:24,188
You wearing a thong?

185
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,273
What?

186
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:32,112
Sparkling cider is very good.

187
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:34,406
I think that's champagne.

188
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,450
Hello, ladies.

189
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:38,786
Who, here, is a history buff?

190
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,037
I-

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,456
Who's a fan of buff naked?

192
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,335
Without further ado,

193
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:52,132
the one, the only, the
sexy, Mr. Benjamin Franklin!

194
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,594
Thank you for that
introduction, Mr. Scott!

195
00:09:55,677 --> 00:10:00,849
And good afternoon, fine
gentlewomen of Dunder Mifflin.

196
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,520
Half pants, right,
Mr. Franklin?

197
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,813
Knickers, in fact. Yes.

198
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,856
He's in his knickers.

199
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,360
Mr. Franklin,
I would say you are probably

200
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,737
one of the sexiest
presidents ever.

201
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,865
Well, actually,
I never was President.

202
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,993
Yes, but Ben Franklin was.

203
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:26,834
I'm here to teach you
a little bit about my life

204
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,378
and the era of
the Founding Fathers...

205
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,007
And when they came
over on the Mayflower.

206
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:39,513
Wait.
This is the entertainment?

207
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:42,391
Yeah, all right, so,
I want you to give him

208
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,059
your undivided attention.

209
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,646
And Mr. Franklin. If any
of these ladies misbehave,

210
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:50,274
I give you
permission to spank them,

211
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,775
especially that one.

212
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,948
Have you ever
seen a stripper before?

213
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:59,158
Yes.

214
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,035
Jennifer Garner
portrayed one on Alias.

215
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,204
It was one of
her many aliases.

216
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,372
Yeah, me neither.

217
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:06,456
Hi.

218
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,293
I'm Elizabeth. I'm the
dancer that was requested.

219
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,377
Okay.

220
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,964
I specifically
ordered a stripper.

221
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,799
I'm the stripper.

222
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,176
Oh, okay. Good.

223
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,803
Well, in the future, please
identify yourself as such.

224
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,513
Oh, God.
Okay.

225
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,140
"Is she hot?"

226
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,814
Text back, "Kind of."

227
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,903
It was a warm
June evening in 1752,

228
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,238
the night of my
fateful kite flight...

229
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,573
Mr. Franklin?
Yes.

230
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:40,908
Do you have a girlfriend?

231
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,285
I have a lovely wife,
Deborah.

232
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,996
But don't you also
have girlfriends in Paris?

233
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,665
Like, a lot of them?

234
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,127
Well, that is
a gray area of my life.

235
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,714
Okay? So it was
a warm June evening...

236
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,800
Look at that.

237
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,802
Nothing like grilling
in the great outdoors.

238
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:05,140
Is it the same grill
you grilled your foot on?

239
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
No.

240
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,602
Yes, but I got
all the foot off of it.

241
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:09,811
Oh, gross.

242
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,813
Okay, Ben Franklin.

243
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,277
Ben Franklin tied
a cherry stem in his mouth!

244
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,447
Well, that is because
I am a Renaissance man.

245
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,785
Ben Franklin? Do you wear
boxers, briefs or pantaloons?

246
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:29,206
Well, you're very saucy.

247
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:36,797
Guys! Beef,
it's what's for dinner.

248
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:39,466
Who wants some man meat?

249
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,093
I do! I want some man meat!

250
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:42,844
Michael, Dwight
would like your man meat.

251
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,639
Well, then,
my man meat he shall have.

252
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,975
There you go.

253
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,269
Deliciosity.

254
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,436
Of course.

255
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,646
Here we go.

256
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:57,359
So I guess, you have the Ben
Franklin wig and the costume

257
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,778
and you figure, "How can
I put this to practical use?"

258
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,405
Well, I'd like to
think that his dad

259
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,198
was a Ben Franklin
impersonator,

260
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,076
and he really
pressured him into it.

261
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:10,247
Hey, I wanted to talk to you.

262
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,000
I know this is
weird or whatever,

263
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,794
but Jim told me
about you guys.

264
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,171
What do you mean?

265
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,840
Well, that you kissed.

266
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,051
And we talked it through
and it's totally fine.

267
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,679
It's not a big deal,
it's just a kiss.

268
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,851
But you're not
still interested in him?

269
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,394
Oh, yeah.

270
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,771
Really?

271
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,817
Oh, no! I was
confused by your phrasing.

272
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,028
You should definitely
go out with Jim.

273
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,946
I mean,
you're going out with Jim.

274
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,531
I'm not going out with Jim.

275
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,700
You're dating him,
which is awesome,

276
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,952
because you guys
are great together.

277
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:50,203
Okay.

278
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,830
And I'm not into Jim.

279
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,623
Yeah.

280
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,460
So, well, good.

281
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:57,961
Yeah.

282
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,547
Sorry.

283
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,966
What are you sorry about?

284
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:06,094
What?

285
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,929
What are you sorry about?

286
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:11,600
Nothing. I was just
thinking of something else.

287
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:15,562
Okay, the game is No-Limit
Deuce-To-Seven Lowball.

288
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,065
Blinds 25/50.
Nickels are worth 10,

289
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,109
dimes, 25, and quarters, 50.
Nothing wild.

290
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,071
I call shuffle! Here we go.

291
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,868
Michael...

292
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,957
Gentlemen,
the entertainment is here.

293
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,877
Everybody, I'd like to
introduce you to Elizabeth.

294
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,128
Hi, guys.

295
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,338
That's a nice outfit.

296
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:44,132
I hear there's
an important meeting here.

297
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,053
I'm not really
into strippers.

298
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:51,014
You know what I find sexy?
Pam's art.

299
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,559
She's an artist
and I appreciate that.

300
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:00,941
It's very moving
and sexy, the art.

301
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,693
Hit it!

302
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,075
So where's the groom?

303
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,910
Oh, he's right there.

304
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:13,161
There he is.

305
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,329
Absolutely not.

306
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,706
That's all you,
that's all you.

307
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,127
Okay! All right, I'll do it.

308
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,296
Yeah, let's do it!
Let's do this thing.

309
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,798
Yeah? What do I...

310
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:25,882
Just sit on down.

311
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,717
All right.
All right.

312
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,177
Okay.
Here we go.

313
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,387
Oh, here we go. All right!

314
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,513
Yes!

315
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,808
Not bad! Not bad!

316
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:37,310
You smell nice, like Tide.

317
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,979
What's that?

318
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:40,981
You smell like
Tide detergent.

319
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,276
Do you use Tide detergent?

320
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,158
I have a girlfriend, so...

321
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:52,951
I bet she'd be jealous!

322
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,122
Yeah, she probably...
Yeah, she would be.

323
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:58,707
You know what?
Okay. Excuse me.

324
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,792
This is sick, please.
Stop it, stop it.

325
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,252
Turn off the music,
because this is wrong.

326
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:04,129
This is wrong! This is wrong.

327
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:08,842
I have a girlfriend. I...

328
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:10,969
And you are engaged

329
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:14,931
and I'm sure you have a boyfriend
in prison or something, so...

330
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,976
Let's just clear out, okay?
Shame on you.

331
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,355
Go back to work!

332
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,569
Elizabeth,
I want you to sit here.

333
00:16:27,652 --> 00:16:29,446
When the phone rings,
answer it.

334
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,741
You want me to answer phones
with my clothes on?

335
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,995
We hired you for three hours'
work, and we're gonna get it.

336
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,877
I love your poster.

337
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,880
Thank you.

338
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,434
You know,
I invented electricity.

339
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,685
I know.

340
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,022
Well, I'm sensing a little
electricity right here.

341
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,692
Didn't Ben Franklin
have syphilis?

342
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,570
Yes, but I don't.

343
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,281
My name is Gordon.

344
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,161
On one hand, I want to be honest
with Jan and tell her the truth.

345
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,456
On the other hand, I'm
afraid she's gonna dump me.

346
00:17:21,998 --> 00:17:25,293
You know, Michael, I
fathered an illegitimate son.

347
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,461
Really?

348
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,880
But I kept all this
from my wife, Deborah.

349
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,800
These things only serve
to upset the women.

350
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,386
They are the gentler sex.

351
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,805
Wow.

352
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:40,517
Ben Franklin, you're
really kind of a sleazebag.

353
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:45,313
Stripper?

354
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,774
Could I ask you
a question about women?

355
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,781
Should I tell my girlfriend
that you danced up on me?

356
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,496
"Secrets, secrets are no fun.

357
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,666
"Secrets,
secrets hurt someone."

358
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,502
Wow.

359
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:10,672
Thank you.

360
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,052
Care for
a piece of chocolate?

361
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,846
Chocolate?
Where did you acquire it?

362
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,556
That is a delicacy
in the Amazon,

363
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:23,059
but it has not yet been
imported to the United States.

364
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,853
Who is the king of Austria?
Joseph II.

365
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:26,646
Who is the king of Prussia?
Friedrich Wilhelm III.

366
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,023
Who is the king of England?

367
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,567
Why, the tyrant,
King George, of course!

368
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,360
I don't care what Jim says.

369
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,821
That is not
the real Ben Franklin.

370
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,157
I am 99% sure.

371
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,786
Michael, I left
a meeting. What is so urgent?

372
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,164
Are you... Are you okay?

373
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,666
Not really.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,878
Look, I don't know how
to say this, so I just will.

375
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,004
Okay.

376
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:55,717
I went to a bachelor party

377
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,971
and things got
a little out of hand.

378
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,309
When... When did...
When, last night?

379
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,519
No, today at work.

380
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,729
You went to
a bachelor party at work?

381
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,023
Yes, I kind of arranged it.

382
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,192
Well, I don't even think
the stripper was that hot.

383
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,027
Did you guys
think she was hot?

384
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,236
Kelly, don't do this.

385
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,404
Do what?
I just asked you a question.

386
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,239
You know
what you're doing.

387
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,243
Anyway, you know who was
totally flirting with Ben Franklin? Pam.

388
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,246
Really? Looks like
I hired the right guy.

389
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,249
I'm glad. Any real
potential there, Beesly?

390
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,669
Yeah, right.

391
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,713
God, I need a boyfriend.

392
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,217
You know, Ryan, I'm...

393
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,510
I'm totally
ready to be set up

394
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:40,261
with one of your
business school friends.

395
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,388
Whenever.

396
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,597
Okay.

397
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,478
Oh, my God, I would
get so fat if I worked here.

398
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,814
Yeah? I lose
my appetite all the time.

399
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,150
You could strip, you know.

400
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,069
Thanks.

401
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:57,821
So you don't want to
end our relationship?

402
00:19:57,987 --> 00:19:59,614
I'm closer to firing you.

403
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,491
That is so sweet.

404
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,412
You are the best GD girlfriend
in the world. Do you know that?

405
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,038
I'll talk to you later.

406
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,373
You are. You are.

407
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,959
So you know who turned
out to be kind of a creep?

408
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,712
Ben Franklin.

409
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:19,467
And, Elizabeth, the stripper, gave
me great advice which rhymed.

410
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:26,307
It really makes you wonder how
Ben Franklin can become President,

411
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,810
but someone like
Elizabeth can't.

412
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,899
Are you near-sighted
or far-sighted?

413
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,694
Both. That's why I
invented the bifocals.
