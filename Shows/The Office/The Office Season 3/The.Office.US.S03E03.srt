1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,299
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,261
Movie Monday!

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:17,137
The only cure I know for the
Monday blues is Varsity Blues.

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,770
Let's go! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

5
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,522
Take a seat down there.
Second from the end.

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,066
All right.
Everybody here? Yes!

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,610
Popcorn, anyone?

8
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,570
Yes, please! Thank you.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,490
Anyone else?

10
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,242
No.

11
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:38,454
Movie Monday
started with training videos.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,416
But we went through those pretty
fast. Then we watched a medical video.

13
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,214
Since then, it's been half-hour
installments of various movies,

14
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,716
with the exception
of an episode of Entourage,

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,718
which Michael made us
watch six times.

16
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,261
Entourage.

17
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:31,173
Kevin? Would you like to do
the scenes from last week?

18
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,299
Yes.

19
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,467
Why him?

20
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,261
Don't whine. Get the windows.

21
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,764
Previously on Varsity Blues...

22
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:42,976
Okay, Billy Bob got a head
injury, but Coach made him play.

23
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:46,688
So then Lance, he gets sacked
and he's out for the year.

24
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,196
Hello?

25
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,949
Not everyone approves
of Movie Monday.

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,119
I won't say who.

27
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:02,621
I don't approve. I don't.

28
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:04,998
Hello?

29
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,090
Let's go after that title now.
Let's go, let's go!

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,510
Let's go!

31
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:21,557
Hi, Jan. Hope you
brought the Milk Duds.

32
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:24,476
How would a movie
increase productivity, Michael?

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,478
How on Earth would it do that?

34
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,398
People work faster after.

35
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:30,607
Magically?

36
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:31,733
No.

37
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,821
They have to, to make up for the
time they lost watching the movie.

38
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,281
No.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,199
Do I need to hire
a babysitter for you, Michael?

40
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,367
Kitchen.

41
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,911
Some little 14-year old girl
whose job it is, is to limit...

42
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,913
Michael is going
to get us all fired.

43
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,999
You sat back and let him
play that dumb movie

44
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,543
and now Jan is peeved off and
we're all going to lose our jobs.

45
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,128
That's not going to happen.

46
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,130
You know she has it
out for him now!

47
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,548
That's not his fault!

48
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,300
He had to follow his heart.

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,760
Ever since Michael
dumped Jan for Carole,

50
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,512
Jan's been
bitching out on him.

51
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,559
Reject a woman, and she will never let it
go. One of the many defects of their kind.

52
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,019
Also weak arms.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,689
Dwight, you should
be running this office.

54
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,902
Michael would never let me.

55
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:18,405
It's not up to Michael,
it's Jan's call.

56
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,199
Talk to her.
I could never do that.

57
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:23,076
Fine! Sit back and do nothing
and let us all get fired.

58
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,290
I know that patience and loyalty
are good and virtuous traits,

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,714
but sometimes I just think
you need to grow a pair.

60
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,677
At the Stamford branch, they all
play this World War II videogame

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,802
called Call of Duty.

62
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,430
And they're all
really into it.

63
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,725
I'm told that it started
as a teambuilding exercise.

64
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,977
Unfortunately,
I really suck at it.

65
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,982
We didn't play many videogames
in Scranton.

66
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,817
Instead, we'd do stuff like...

67
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,780
Pam and I would sometimes hum
the same high-pitched note

68
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,575
and try to get Dwight to make
an appointment with an ear doctor.

69
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:08,534
And Pam called it
Pretendonitis.

70
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,458
Hey, Kelly,
my stuff just got here.

71
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,794
Oh! Oh, my God!

72
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,171
Kelly really likes
to online shop.

73
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,592
So, I felt like I wanted
some new clothes.

74
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,762
I mean, I just...
I wanted to...

75
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:29,138
It's just, I felt like it was time
to maybe, just get new clothes.

76
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,980
Okay.

77
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,399
I love it!

78
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,067
Really? I don't know.

79
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,444
No, you haven't even
tried it on yet. Try it on.

80
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:40,904
Not at work. I'll try it on...

81
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:43,907
Fashion show.
Fashion show at lunch!

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,161
No...

83
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,955
Fashion show,
fashion show at lunch.

84
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:53,458
Fashion show! Fashion show!
Fashion show at lunch!

85
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,380
Why did you do that?

86
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,174
I'm just killing Germans
any way I can.

87
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,592
We're on the German team.

88
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,386
Shoot the British.

89
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,640
Wait, are we playing teams?

90
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:09,891
Yeah.

91
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,616
Hello?

92
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:26,825
Is this Jan?

93
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,951
Who is this?

94
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,953
This is Dwight Schrute.

95
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:33,957
I am calling about
an extremely sensitive matter.

96
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,043
You should talk to Michael
and he'll talk to me,

97
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,710
and that way we don't have to
speak to each other.

98
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,880
It's about Michael.

99
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,256
What about him?

100
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:45,052
I can't talk here.
It's too sensitive.

101
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,428
It's not about
a surprise party, is it?

102
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,723
No, but we should discuss that
another time.

103
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,477
Look, I'm already an hour outside of
Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.

104
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,105
Pull over at Exit 40.

105
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,274
There is
a Liz Claiborne outlet.

106
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:04,442
I know you like that store. Go
inside and shop until I can meet you.

107
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:06,990
How do you know
I like that store?

108
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,201
Many of your blouses
are Claibornes.

109
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,744
How do you know that?

110
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,995
It's part of my job.

111
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,040
No, it's not.
It's officially not.

112
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,917
Noted.

113
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:20,587
I'm going to the dentist.

114
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,005
Okay.

115
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,300
I have to have
an emergency crown put in.

116
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,469
Yes.

117
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,138
It's a new dentist.

118
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:35,019
He's far. I might
be gone three hours.

119
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,480
Three hours? Wow! Have fun.

120
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,863
Did you get anything good?

121
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,073
Yeah.

122
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,202
New blouse? Halter-top?

123
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,540
Camisole? Teddy?

124
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,041
I could save the branch.

125
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,167
Really?

126
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,586
If you let me run it.

127
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,754
Okay.

128
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,340
Okay, I can run it?

129
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,925
What would you do differently?

130
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:11,346
Mostly get rid of waste,
which is half the people there.

131
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,098
And clean house.

132
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,601
Right here, it's all for me.

133
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:18,228
Thank you.

134
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,355
Dwight, you must feel strongly
to speak with me this way,

135
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,817
behind Michael's back, and turn
on so many of your co-workers.

136
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:27,820
The decision to turn
on Michael was difficult.

137
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,532
But once I did it,
I didn't look back.

138
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,451
And mostly I feel
that Michael would approve.

139
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,079
It's really what's best
for the branch.

140
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,624
And I could care less
about my co-workers.

141
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,712
So, here we are.

142
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,089
It's all on the table.

143
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,469
I want the branch.

144
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,096
And I await your decision.

145
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,019
Oh, by the way, there's a new
Ann Taylor outlet store near here.

146
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,985
I know you like
their earrings.

147
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,238
Where is it?

148
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,573
Michael!
Hi.

149
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,785
I had a very interesting conversation
with one of your employees.

150
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,786
Oh, that's nice.
No, it wasn't.

151
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,832
Dwight just told me that he thinks
he can run the branch better than you.

152
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,584
What?

153
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,128
You were at the dentist?

154
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,754
You can't have people
undermining you.

155
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,840
Get control of your
branch immediately. Okay.

156
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:31,259
What was Dwight thinking?
That he could turn Jan against me?

157
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,554
She's my ex-lover-ish.

158
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:38,391
Wow!

159
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,060
It's so sexy! You look so hot.

160
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,646
It's really something.

161
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,856
It's too much.

162
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,482
What?
I'm gonna return it.

163
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,527
No. You have to keep it today,
just see how you feel.

164
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,655
Hi.

165
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,198
You look nice.

166
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,533
Thanks.

167
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,328
Isn't that, like,
your third soda today?

168
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:03,541
Yeah, I think we can be a
big help to your company.

169
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,419
Okay, see you next week. Bye.

170
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,339
Again?

171
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,674
Scared?

172
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,425
Call of Duty.

173
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,139
Andy, Jim, can I see you in the
conference room for a minute?

174
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,641
Now?
Yes, now.

175
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,101
Put the game on hold,
everyone.

176
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,688
This is not working, okay? We
are getting slaughtered out there.

177
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,190
It's the new guy.

178
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,733
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know
what we're talking about.

179
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:29,859
See what I mean?

180
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:31,444
We just need a strategy, okay?

181
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,530
We're gonna set up a trap
in the gunroom. All right?

182
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,116
Jim, are you using
the MP40 or the .44?

183
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,367
Sniper rifle?

184
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,576
Snipe...
What?

185
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,578
Jim! In Carentan? Are you
playing for the other team?

186
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,497
You don't snipe
in Carentan, okay?

187
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,041
It's saboteur! Saboteur!

188
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,126
Andy, it's not...

189
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,961
I'm gonna kill you for real.

190
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:51,297
This game, the game is over.
I'm really going to shoot you.

191
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,145
Hey, Dwight.

192
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,355
Do you want an M&M?

193
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:07,647
No, thanks. I'm stuffed.

194
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:11,151
No, seriously, you should have
an M&M, they're really good.

195
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,029
Okay.

196
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,790
Good, huh?

197
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,292
So good.

198
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:36,176
Hey, I thought you weren't supposed
to eat anything for a couple of hours

199
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,262
after you've had
a crown put in.

200
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:46,269
They have this new kind
of quick-drying bonding. So...

201
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,645
Sounds like a good dentist.

202
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:48,813
Oh, yeah.

203
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,941
What's his name?

204
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,074
Crentist.

205
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,786
Your dentist's name
is Crentist?

206
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,954
Yeah.

207
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,710
Sounds a lot like dentist.

208
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,297
Maybe that's why
he became a dentist.

209
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,511
Let me see your teeth.

210
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,597
Let me see them.
Let me see them.

211
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,485
You should floss them.

212
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,362
I know.

213
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,367
Well, then.

214
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm glad you're okay.

215
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:54,879
Business is like a jungle.
And I am like a tiger.

216
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,673
And Dwight is like a monkey that
stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.

217
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,349
Does the tiger
fire the monkey?

218
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:11,021
Does the tiger transfer the
monkey to another branch?

219
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:13,690
Pun.

220
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:20,359
There's no way of knowing what
goes on inside the tiger's head.

221
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,950
We don't have the technology.

222
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,705
Dwight, can I talk to you
for a second?

223
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,256
Wow. This is tough!

224
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:41,009
What?

225
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,724
What is it?

226
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,392
Well...

227
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,938
I just got off
the phone with Jan.

228
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,774
And...

229
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,070
She demoted me.

230
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,115
Yeah.

231
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:08,327
You know what the craziest part of
this is? She demoted me to your job.

232
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,126
And she said that you should be
expecting a call later from corporate,

233
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,461
and that...

234
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,507
I guess that means that you are going to be
acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

235
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,925
I can't believe this news.

236
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,304
That... Wow!

237
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,513
Yeah.

238
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:30,391
I told her I didn't know
whether you'd want to do it

239
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,977
because you've always
been so loyal to me.

240
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:35,730
You've been
my most trusted ally.

241
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:37,190
You said that?

242
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:43,112
Yup, I did. I did.

243
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,120
But I think you should do it.

244
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:57,623
Well, gosh, if you think
I should then I will.

245
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,927
Perfect. Well, we're settled.

246
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,887
All right.
All right.

247
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:10,932
Well, then you are now
Acting Manager

248
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,434
of Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton branch,

249
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,353
and I am
Assistant Regional Manager.

250
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,855
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.

251
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,774
Thank you, Michael, for
staying on, I really appreciate it.

252
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,442
Hey, hey. Oh...

253
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,863
I can't imagine
this place without you.

254
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,866
Can't you? That's so nice.

255
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:37,333
Well, I guess we should
go tell the troops.

256
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,210
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.

257
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,672
Okay, let's do it.

258
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:51,347
Hey, hi, hello, everybody.

259
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:54,684
I have some good news
and I have some bad news.

260
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,022
I am being replaced as
your leader by Dwight.

261
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,524
You're kidding.

262
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,860
You might think that I am
kidding, and I understand that.

263
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,654
Congratulations, Dwight.

264
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:06,988
Thank you, Angela.

265
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,658
But, why Dwight?

266
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,577
Because Dwight never lies.

267
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,830
How does that qualify him
to run a branch?

268
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,665
Because that's all it takes.

269
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,875
Okay, Dwight, would you like to say a
few words to everybody about loyalty?

270
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:24,464
Thank you, Michael.

271
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,385
I just want to say, to the few of you
who will remain under my employ,

272
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,389
that I intend to lead you
into the black with ferocity!

273
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:34,724
Michael? What will you do?

274
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,975
Oh, I'll be fine.

275
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,227
Do you have any savings?

276
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,644
No, no, I don't. But...

277
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:40,479
Michael, you might
lose your condo.

278
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,566
I won't. I won't.

279
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,777
I have this little old vacuum
cleaner that's broken.

280
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,697
If Dwight doesn't work out,
maybe that could be manager.

281
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,406
Maybe I'll quit.

282
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,283
It's really happening.

283
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,493
Yes.

284
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,581
We can make a difference here.

285
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,584
I will make a difference here.

286
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,295
You alone?

287
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,546
"Cause I thought
together we were...

288
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,215
Oh, please! Don't be naive.

289
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,719
But you can be
in charge of the women.

290
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,854
Look how cute he is.

291
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,607
And he's trying to shoot
with a smoke grenade.

292
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,109
I'm sorry, what are you
whispering about me?

293
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,945
No, nothing. Just
concentrate on turning around.

294
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,613
Yeah, I'm trying, I just...

295
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:32,448
Just tap "S" then "D."

296
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,658
Oh.

297
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,327
Any last words? No?

298
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,577
What?

299
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,249
Wow!

300
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,795
Psychopath.

301
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,552
What?

302
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,763
I'm just looking.

303
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,598
Please go back to your desk.

304
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:58,808
In a minute.

305
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,607
Well, I remember why
I dress the way I do at work.

306
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,483
But I'm gonna
keep the clothes.

307
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:11,362
I mean, it'll just be cool to have some
after-work clothes that aren't pajamas.

308
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:23,537
Well, I guess it's time that I turn
over the keys to the famous Sebring.

309
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:27,921
No, thank you.

310
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,463
It's a corporate lease,
Dwight, you've earned it.

311
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,383
No, thanks.
What?

312
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:33,217
Not my style.

313
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:39,181
But you said you liked it.
You've always admired it. And...

314
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,309
But that was before. I'm thinking
about getting something German,

315
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,685
something with
decent gas mileage.

316
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,230
Plus, that convertible is a
ridiculous choice for this climate.

317
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,859
Take it back.

318
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,403
No.

319
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,700
That's my car.

320
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,955
What did you...
That's my car!

321
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:04,582
Yes.

322
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,710
I know, Dwight, I know.
I know, I know.

323
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,128
You know what?

324
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:11,380
Jan called me
about your little meeting!

325
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:12,548
No.

326
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,259
I know what you did.

327
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,469
You... The Sebring's cool...

328
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,637
I made the whole thing up,
Dwight!

329
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,888
It's cool,
the Sebring's cool...

330
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,890
Oh, do you? Do you like it?
And has a cassette and a CD.

331
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,850
How dare you?
How dare you, Dwight?

332
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,477
Don't fire me.

333
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:26,354
Please, don't...

334
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,982
Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't fire you right here on the spot?

335
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,691
I have excellent
sales numbers!

336
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,485
Not good enough!

337
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,071
I'll do anything! Anything!

338
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,489
Please, I'll do your laundry
for a month!

339
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,699
For a year!

340
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:40,075
I have a laundry machine!

341
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,581
I'm sorry. Anything... I'll...

342
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:46,290
Please? Please?

343
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,002
I don't know if I can trust
you anymore. You can't.

344
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:51,921
You can't, but I promise
I'll never betray you again.

345
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,800
What can I do, Michael?
What can I do?

346
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,719
What can I do?

347
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:00,638
What can I do?

348
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:02,723
What can I do?

349
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,850
You can get up.

350
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,143
What?

351
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:07,895
Get up.

352
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:16,404
And you can hug it out, bitch.

353
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,831
"Hug it out, bitch."”

354
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:31,126
That is what men say to each
other after a fight. They hug it out.

355
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,005
And in doing so,
they just let it go.

356
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,925
And walk away,
and they're done.

357
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:43,389
Not a good idea to say that to a
woman, however, I have found.

358
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,225
Doesn't translate.

359
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,301
Yup, yup, we hugged it out.

360
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,806
But it turns out
I was still a little angry

361
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,977
and so I felt I needed to
punish him just a little bit more.

362
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:33,188
And I'm making him
do my laundry for a year.
