1
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:07,047
Hey, Kevin. Nice of you
to join us. Where were you?

2
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,675
My tire blew out
on the way here, Michael.

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,928
I almost died. I went
into this skid... Pop quiz.

4
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,222
What?
Why is today a special day?

5
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,724
I almost died.
Today is a special day

6
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:20,686
because I am being honored

7
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:25,607
as a visiting professor.

8
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,401
Special lecturer?

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,653
Emeritus, how did you put it?

10
00:00:29,737 --> 00:00:31,113
You will be a guest speaker

11
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,073
in my
Emerging Enterprises class.

12
00:00:33,157 --> 00:00:36,243
In business school, Kevin.

13
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,245
Business school.
Wow.

14
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:40,247
If you bring
your boss to class,

15
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,791
it automatically bumps you up
a full-letter grade.

16
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,668
So,

17
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,714
I'd be stupid
not to do it, right?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,675
A boss is like a teacher.

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,844
And I am like
the cool teacher.

20
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,971
Like Mr. Handell.

21
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,849
Mr. Handell would hang out
with us,

22
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,893
and he would tell us
awesome jokes.

23
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,271
And he actually hooked up
with one of the students,

24
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,482
and then, like,
12 other kids came forward.

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,360
It was in all the papers.

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,738
Really ruined
eighth grade for us.

27
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:38,555
Here we go. College road show.
Gotta bring our A game.

28
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,017
What is the most inspiring
thing I ever said to you?

29
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,394
"Don't be an idiot."
Changed my life.

30
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:46,938
Whenever I'm about
to do something,

31
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,442
I think,
"Would an idiot do that?"

32
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,319
And if they would,
I do not do that thing.

33
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,907
Will they throw their
hats, you think? What?

34
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,869
A lot of times,
at a school or naval academy,

35
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,079
after a rousing speech,

36
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,331
the crowd will throw its hats
high into the air.

37
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,668
You understand, nobody's
graduating. Yeah, I know. I know.

38
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,086
I'm just saying,
if they did throw their hats,

39
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,671
I've got a great line
for that.

40
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,385
May your hats fly
as high your dreams!

41
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,767
That was a pretty good line.
I'm just...

42
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:28,309
It doesn't apply. I understand!
Wow! Relax, spazzy boy!

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,024
Sometimes you're such a
little spaz! God, I'm driving!

44
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:32,567
Hey!
Quit it.

45
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,819
We have fun!

46
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,488
I can't wait
for your art show tonight.

47
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:37,948
Okay, just so you know,

48
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,367
it's just the students from
my class in a little studio.

49
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,662
I wouldn't miss it for
the world. Thanks.

50
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,998
I'm really happy
to be back with Roy.

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,790
I think it shows maturity,
maturity and dignity.

52
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,925
Is that braggy?
I don't mean it to be braggy.

53
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,260
Love you!
You, too.

54
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,639
<i>Pam's with Roy,
I'm with Karen,</i>

55
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,560
and Brangelina is
with Frangelina. Moving on!

56
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,731
I can't believe
you're back together with Roy.

57
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,318
Oh, yeah. We have such
a solid foundation, you know.

58
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,238
Oh, my God,
you're so in love now.

59
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,324
Yeah. You should come
to my art show, by the way.

60
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,367
Art show!

61
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,660
I mean, it's not a big deal,

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,122
but I think a lot of people from
the office are gonna be there.

63
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:30,834
Yeah. Definitely,
I'll be there. For sure.

64
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,630
Campus. Brings back SO many
memories that I would have made.

65
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,845
Hey, Frisbee! Check that out!

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,015
What do you say we get our
frizz on before class? Come on.

67
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,186
Yeah!

68
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,483
Dude!

69
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,909
Oh, my God.

70
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:11,541
Animal stool.

71
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,097
Dwight, what are you doing?

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,058
Solving a mystery, if that's
quite all right with you!

73
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,566
Come to papa!

74
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,154
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

75
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,780
What we have here is a bird

76
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,949
that has been trapped
in a vent.

77
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,451
Fortunately,
I have found it before...

78
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,954
Bat! Get it out!

79
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,957
Bat! Bat!
Oh, my God!

80
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,501
Bat!
What do you mean...

81
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,378
No, I won't remain calm!

82
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,967
There it goes!
Goodbye.

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,678
God, this is Angela Martin.

84
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,055
Please don't let that stupid
thing come anywhere near me.

85
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,515
Please make it go away!

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,270
Okay. This is it. Ryan
is doing my intro right now.

87
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,774
Dunder Mifflin can't compete
with the modern chains,

88
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:20,611
and management is unwilling
or unable to adapt.

89
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:21,945
Their customers
are dying off...

90
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,074
I can't hear what he's saying,

91
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:28,285
but he looks like
he's really into it.

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,128
We have a bat in the office.

93
00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:40,547
Simple solution would be
to open a window,

94
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,217
if we had windows
that could open.

95
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:46,636
Poop is raining
from the ceilings.

96
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:48,305
Poop.

97
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,807
Okay, thanks.

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,061
Animal Control
will be here at 6:00.

99
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:57,063
At 6:007?
No, that is unacceptable.

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,233
Okay, Jim. You are the
number two in this office.

101
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,942
You need to step up
and show some leadership!

102
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,904
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

103
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,656
So weird.
What? What's so weird?

104
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,700
The bat... I mean,
I know I felt it bite me,

105
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:10,035
but look, there's no mark.

106
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,539
I feel so tingly,

107
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,793
so strangely powerful.

108
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,839
Oh, well.

109
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,720
And now, without further ado,

110
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,305
I present the regional manager

111
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,016
of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton,
Michael Scott.

112
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,698
Hello, everyone,
I am Michael Scott...

113
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,032
Hello, I'm Brandon Fidalgo,

114
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,368
CEO of The Teaching Company.
These...

115
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:57,995
And I'd like to start today
by inspiring you.

116
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,171
May I borrow someone's
textbook, please?

117
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,423
Thank you.

118
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,426
What have we here?
Ooh, economics.

119
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,011
Very, very interesting.

120
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,854
You cannot learn from books.

121
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:25,778
Replace these pages
with life lessons,

122
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:30,361
and then you will have a book

123
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,745
that is worth
its weight in gold.

124
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:41,497
I know, those are expensive,
but the lesson is priceless.

125
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,253
Good.

126
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:45,964
All right,
I think you're inspired.

127
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,632
Shall we proceed?

128
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,677
There are four kinds
of business,

129
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,261
tourism, food service,
railroads and sales.

130
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,979
And hospitals/manufacturing.

131
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,649
And air travel.

132
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,862
This is your job, Halpert.

133
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,489
Ow!

134
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,449
What happened?

135
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,869
That bread on your desk. I
just picked it up. It's white hot.

136
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:20,039
But, Jim, this garlic
bread is cold. What?

137
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,460
No, it burned me, I...

138
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,089
Bizarre.

139
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,717
No.

140
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:33,428
No. One crisis at a time.

141
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:36,264
If a vampire bat
was in the U.S.,

142
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,599
it would make sense
for it to come

143
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,144
to a "Sylvania,"
like Pennsylvania.

144
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,896
Now, that doesn't mean

145
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,731
that Jim is gonna
become a vampire.

146
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:48,485
Only that he carries
the vampiric germ.

147
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,906
So, you want to start a
business. How do you start?

148
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:57,160
What do you need? Well,
first of all, you need a building.

149
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:03,287
And secondly, you need supply,
you need something to sell.

150
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,169
Now, this could be anything.

151
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:10,753
It could be a thingamajig
or a who's-he-what's-he

152
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:15,595
or a Whatchamacallit.

153
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,806
Now, you need to sell those
in order to have a PayDay.

154
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:28,900
And if you sell
enough of them,

155
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,447
you will make a 100 GRAND.

156
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,285
Satisfied?

157
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,912
This looks great.
I'd love to be there,

158
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,039
but my daughter's play
is tonight.

159
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,584
Damn it!

160
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,046
You know, one of the other
parents will probably videotape it.

161
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,298
So...
Oh, no, you should go.

162
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:55,635
Well, it's important
to support local art.

163
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,846
You know?
And what they do is not art.

164
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,518
Okay, I'm seeing some
confused faces out there.

165
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,062
Let me slow down a little bit,
break this down.

166
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:07,230
Okay.

167
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:11,151
The more stickers you sell,
the more profit,

168
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,778
fancy word for money,

169
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:17,073
you have to buy PlayStations
and Beanie Babies...

170
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,199
Michael...
...and products!

171
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,868
What we normally do here is
more of a question and answer thing.

172
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,245
Well, okay... I'm just kind
of getting going...

173
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:25,081
Yeah, I know.
All right, okay.

174
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:28,126
Well, we can do questions.
Okay, very good. First hand up.

175
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,254
Sir, as a company that
primarily distributes paper,

176
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,214
how have you adapted
your business model

177
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,301
to function in an increasingly
paperless world?

178
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,679
We can't overestimate
the value of computers.

179
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:44,100
Yes, they are great for playing
games and forwarding funny e-mails,

180
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,855
but real business
is done on paper, okay?

181
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:50,940
Write that down.

182
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,740
Hey, Jim, here's the aspirin
you wanted.

183
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,827
Oh, thank God. I've such
a headache from that glare.

184
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,202
What glare?

185
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,998
The glare off Angela's
crucifix. It's blinding.

186
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,377
I don't have a lot
of experience with vampires,

187
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,878
but I have hunted werewolves.

188
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,632
I shot one once,
but by the time I got to it,

189
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,385
it had turned back
into my neighbor's dog.

190
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:27,351
Extraordinary events call
for extraordinary actions.

191
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,021
Will you form an allegiance...
Sure.

192
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,107
...to use sudden violence?
Okay.

193
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,151
Do you have the tools

194
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,903
to turn a wooden mop handle
into a stake?

195
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,407
What size?

196
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,159
What do you say to a customer
who wants to leave you

197
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:46,246
for the convenience and
savings of a nationwide chain?

198
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,373
I say,
"You will miss our service

199
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,460
"and I absolutely guarantee
you'll come back."

200
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,253
Has anyone ever come back?

201
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:56,089
We don't want them back.
They're stupid.

202
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,842
How far has your Herfindahl
Index declined since the merger?

203
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,219
Nice try. How's your
Polack-says-what Index?

204
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,346
What?
Thanks, Kowalski.

205
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,473
Can we get back on track here?

206
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,725
By your own
employee's calculation,

207
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,561
you'll be obsolete
in the next five to ten years.

208
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,857
Wait. Ryan said that?

209
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,826
What are you doing?

210
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,455
You better not hurt that little
bat. Animals can't feel pain.

211
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,831
Don't hurt that bat, Creed!

212
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,209
It's a living thing
with feelings and a family!

213
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:37,088
Flush him towards the door.
On my go! Now!

214
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,508
Bat!
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

215
00:12:43,303 --> 00:12:46,180
I am a hero.

216
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,727
Yeah, sure. You know business.

217
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,311
Sitting up here in your ivory
tower and your ebony tower.

218
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:57,734
Well, you know what?

219
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,904
I tell you one thing,
Dunder Mifflin is here to stay!

220
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,572
But how can you compete
against a company

221
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,032
with the resources
of a nationwide chain?

222
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,409
David will always
beat Goliath!

223
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:08,119
But there's five Goliaths.

224
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,747
There's Staples, OfficeMax...
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,917
You know what else
is facing five Goliaths?

226
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,920
America. Al-Qaeda.

227
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:20,340
Global warming. Sex predators.

228
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:23,926
Mercury poisoning.

229
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,096
So do we just give up?

230
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,055
Is that what we're
learning in business school?

231
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,349
But in the big picture,
you have...

232
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,643
Dunder Mifflin
is the big picture!

233
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,272
Can't you understand that?
No, you can't, you're {00 young.

234
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,526
Ryan has never made a sale.

235
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,699
And he started a fire,
trying to make a cheesy pita.

236
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:51,037
And everybody thinks he's a
tease. Well, you know what?

237
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,875
He doesn't know anything
and neither do you.

238
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,381
So, suck on that!

239
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,991
It wasn't personal.
Business is always personal.

240
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,493
It's the most personal thing
in the world.

241
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,369
When we get back to the
office, pack your things.

242
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,955
Pack my... You heard
me. Pack your things.

243
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,468
I really want to come out!
Good night, Mary Beth!

244
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:02,400
So, you're cool to just wait
here for Animal Control?

245
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,068
Animal Control?

246
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,821
I've been controlling animals
since I was six.

247
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,490
Cool. Okay.

248
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,579
I'm gonna go home and
lie down, draw the shades.

249
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,790
There's just
so much sun in here.

250
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,880
Bye, Dwight.

251
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:28,426
Goodbye, Jim.

252
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,930
And good luck.

253
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,060
Jim is on a path now,

254
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,773
an eternal journey,
and I wish him well.

255
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,567
But I have a destiny
in this realm.

256
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:47,695
Specifically, in the kitchen.

257
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:50,782
And it's all
from the same series.

258
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,368
Called Impressions.

259
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,331
Not that I would call myself
an impressionist per se.

260
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,293
But maybe one day.
I hope so.

261
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:06,839
I still need, you know,
my breakthrough or whatever.

262
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,762
- Hey, babe.
- Hey!

263
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,389
How are you?
Good.

264
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,142
I brought my brother.
Hey, Kenny.

265
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:18,768
Hey, Pam.
Hey.

266
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,812
How about this, huh?

267
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,233
I show up with my brother
and no one from work is here.

268
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,069
That's pretty cool, huh?

269
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,786
Magic time.

270
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,545
My hair!

271
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,465
Get off! Get off me!

272
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:52,218
Get it off me! Get off me!
Hold still, woman!

273
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,262
Get it off!
I got it! I got it!

274
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,430
Get it off!

275
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,442
You're welcome.

276
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,949
It's cool if I go, right? I
mean, I looked at all of them.

277
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,743
Yeah. I'll just...
I'll drive myself home.

278
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,495
To my place?

279
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,332
Maybe. I'm a little tired.

280
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,545
Your art was the
prettiest art of all the art.

281
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,714
Thank you.

282
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,802
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

283
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,305
I was just trying
to do my presentation.

284
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,599
And, of course I was wrong

285
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,019
to suggest that Dunder Mifflin
might ever go out of business.

286
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,522
But you don't have to fire me.

287
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,982
Fire you? No, no, no.

288
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,819
You are moving to the annex.

289
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,195
To the annex?

290
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:55,281
Where Kelly is?

291
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,824
A good manager
doesn't fire people.

292
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,285
He hires people
and inspires people.

293
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,289
People, Ryan.

294
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,711
And people will never go
out of business.

295
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:13,466
You're the one who said
we needed more culture.

296
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,803
This is culture to you?
It's her first try.

297
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:18,679
Yeah. On Van Gogh's
first try,

298
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,222
he drew the hands
of the peasants.

299
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,558
Meaning what?

300
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,521
Meaning real art takes
courage, okay, and honesty.

301
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,939
Well, those aren't
Pam'sstrong points.

302
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,568
Yeah, exactly.
That's why this is motel art.

303
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,241
Thanks for coming.

304
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,840
Pamcasso!

305
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:57,551
Sorry I'm late. I had to race
across town. Oh, Michael.

306
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,346
Wow!

307
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,350
You did these? Freehand?
Yep.

308
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,686
My God,
these could be tracings.

309
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,941
Look at this one. Wow!

310
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:14,318
You nailed it.

311
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,325
How much?

312
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:24,954
What do you mean?
I don't see a price.

313
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,583
You want to buy it?
Well, yeah.

314
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,629
Yeah, we have to have it
for the office.

315
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,965
I mean, there's my window.

316
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,508
And there's my car!

317
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:39,844
Is that your car?

318
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,560
That is our building.

319
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:52,857
And we sell paper.

320
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,115
I am really proud of you.

321
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,419
Thank you.

322
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,422
What?

323
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:21,218
Do you have something
in your pocket?

324
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,347
A Chunky.

325
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,895
Do you want half?
No, thank you.

326
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,273
Okay.

327
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,692
It is a message.

328
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:42,194
It is an inspiration.
It is a source of beauty.

329
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:48,371
And without paper,
it could not have happened.

330
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,458
Unless you had a camera.

331
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,754
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

332
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,215
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

333
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,593
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! It's only temporary, okay?

334
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:05,554
Don't get excited.
I won't. I won't. I won't.

335
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,848
I won't. I won't! I won't!

336
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,683
I won't! I won't! I won't!
I won't! I won't!
