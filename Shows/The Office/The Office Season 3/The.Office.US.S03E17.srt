1
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,922
Can you confirm
that the straps are tight?

2
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,381
Yes.

3
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:09,759
But this seems a little...

4
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:11,219
And now the chains.

5
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,973
A lot of people think that
magic camp is just for kids.

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,310
And that's why so many other
people in my class were kids.

7
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,479
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,693
It's really for anybody with a
dream and a belief in magic,

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,780
and a little extra time
after school.

10
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:34,867
Magic, magic, magic.

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,913
And now, Michael
the Magic will attempt

12
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:41,415
to escape
from extreme bondage.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,669
Can he do it?
I don't see how he can.

14
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:45,920
I know how.

15
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,713
He'll dislocate his shoulder
and slip his arm out.

16
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,049
No. No.

17
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,718
Everyone, now
count down with me.

18
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:55,137
Three...
Sorry. Sorry, quick thing.

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,306
So is it true that
if you can't get out,

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,683
you don't want anyone
to help you?

21
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:01,686
I will get out.
Oh, yes. I will.

22
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,273
So we shouldn't help you no matter
how much you might beg and plead?

23
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:08,609
No. All right. Just... This is getting
hot, so let's just do this, okay?

24
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,238
Ready! Three! Two! One!

25
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,406
Go!

26
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,936
Is everything okay, Michael?

27
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:45,813
Yes.

28
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,484
I cannot tell you
how I plan to escape

29
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:53,404
other than by using magic.

30
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,823
That is the magician's code.

31
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,370
Separately on
an unrelated note,

32
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,915
if you happen to find
a small brass key...

33
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:32,193
All right, ready? Come on,
guys. Early worm gets the worm.

34
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,737
Another worm, like,
are they friends?

35
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,280
That's, "Early bird
gets the worm."

36
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,490
Okay.

37
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,076
Pam, would you smell
my breath?

38
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,160
No. No.

39
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:42,703
Let me smell.

40
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,000
Good. Not great.

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,795
Michael, you go to parties all
the time. Why is tonight so special?

42
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,380
Well, tonight is so special

43
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,882
because my boss's
boss's boss, the CFO,

44
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:57,718
not his initials,
common mistake,

45
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,303
is having a little shindig

46
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,347
for all the managers
in the company.

47
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,850
And Jan and I are going
as a couple for the first time.

48
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:08,312
So it's kind of our
coming out party, really.

49
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,940
And that is why tonight
IS SO special.

50
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,608
Jimbo, last chance, carpool.

51
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,402
Oh, no thanks. I think
Karen and I will take my car.

52
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,778
You sure? Might be
a good idea... Yeah.

53
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,322
...if we all went together, we could
save some gas, have fun. Long trip.

54
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,491
Thanks.
Play some games?

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,119
Not... Yeah.
I Spy.

56
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,705
Why don't I wanna go?

57
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,833
Didn't expect to need a
reason. So, let me think here.

58
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,961
I don't know
any of these people.

59
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,087
It's an obligation.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,048
I don't like talking paper
in my free time.

61
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,591
Or in my work time.

62
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,678
And did I use
the word "pointless"?

63
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,472
Thanks for inviting me along.

64
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,724
Oh, sure.

65
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,434
I really didn't give it
any thought.

66
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,560
Wait, should you be going?

67
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,314
- Hello, you.
- Michael?

68
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,649
Hey, buttercup.

69
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,526
I am on my way. I should
be there in about 15...

70
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,361
All right, let's just blow
this party off.

71
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,321
That's what she said.
Yeah.

72
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,115
Am I on speakerphone?

73
00:04:01,198 --> 00:04:02,658
Yes, you are.

74
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,784
Is anybody else...

75
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,952
Hello, Jan!

76
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:07,788
Hi, Dwight. Okay, Michael,
take me off speakerphone.

77
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,290
No problem.

78
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,168
Okay, let's just go
to a motel and...

79
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,294
Okay.

80
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,671
...just, like, rip
into each other like we did

81
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,631
on that black sand beach
in Jamaica.

82
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,799
Okay, Jan?

83
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:22,094
Jan, this party is actually
a very big step for us.

84
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,179
Sol...

85
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:24,805
I'm still on speaker?

86
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:27,224
...1... I don't know.

87
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,350
Are the cameras there?

88
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,560
Maybe.

89
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,395
Okay. See you soon.

90
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,607
Okay. All right. Bye.
Talk to you later, Jan.

91
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,025
Hey, Michael left early.

92
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,527
So a bunch of us are gonna go
to Poor Richards for happy hour.

93
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,862
You should come.

94
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,030
I can't.

95
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:46,076
My brother, he just unloaded the
jet skis and he, kind of, took a bath,

96
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,620
SO we're gonna go
get hammered.

97
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:50,122
Okay. Well,
we're going to a bar.

98
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,212
Hey, you have to come
to stuff with me.

99
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,839
I'm serious.

100
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,924
If you're going to be
my boyfriend,

101
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,926
you have to do
boyfriend things.

102
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,347
Okay.

103
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,142
I've decided that I'm going
to be more honest.

104
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,312
I'm gonna start telling people
what I want directly.

105
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:17,858
So look out world 'cause old
Pammy is getting what she wants.

106
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,694
And don't call me Pammy.

107
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:23,614
Beauty.

108
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:25,324
Thank you, sir.
Thanks a lot.

109
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,742
Thank you.

110
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,288
You're dressed
exactly like the servants.

111
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,748
Shut up.

112
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:34,875
Okay, change shirts with me.

113
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,043
Wait.

114
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,962
I don't think
yours will fit me.

115
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,922
I don't care.

116
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,179
Oh, wow.

117
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,015
Here.

118
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,185
Don't put my jacket on...
Don't give me that.

119
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,187
That would have been
really embarrassing.

120
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,355
Yes.

121
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,606
Crisis averted.

122
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,732
Okay

123
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,324
That duck is so cute.

124
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,121
Hey, Pam.

125
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,455
Hey, guys.

126
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,374
Oscar. Angela.

127
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,711
Hi!

128
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:23,507
Actually, it's polite to arrive early.
And smart.

129
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:26,927
Only really good friends
show up early.

130
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:31,056
Ergo, de facto, go to a party
early, become a really good friend.

131
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,975
Oh, potato salad?

132
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,059
It's from both of us.

133
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,603
No, it's not.

134
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,607
Wonderful. Let's see
where we can put this.

135
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,983
Okay.

136
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,527
Oh, you know, you probably
want to leave the cover on

137
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:44,778
until the guests get here.

138
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,615
It's been sitting
in my car all day.

139
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:51,285
Sun beating down
on the mayonnaise.

140
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,788
Just... You never know.

141
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,417
Kevin, you and Stacy
set a date yet?

142
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,710
Yeah.

143
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:00,961
Oh, my God. When is it?

144
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,379
It's complicated.

145
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,216
I would appreciate
some space on this.

146
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,927
Hey!

147
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,305
Hey! You made it.

148
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,640
Well, you said
it was important, so...

149
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,974
It is.

150
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,976
How's it going?

151
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,061
What's up, Pam?

152
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:19,355
Hey, Kenny.
Sorry about the jet skis.

153
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,275
You guys all want
a round on me?

154
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,443
Yeah!
Yeah?

155
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:25,653
Let's get you a drink.
Thanks, man.

156
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,820
I'm thirsty.

157
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,614
No, thank you. Roy, I...

158
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,157
You should
get a round, Pam.

159
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,871
Oh, you know that line
on the top of the shrimp?

160
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,165
That's feces.

161
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,294
What you looking for?
You bring dip?

162
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,463
I'm sure that it's catered.

163
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,215
I need you
to sign these, Michael.

164
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,176
It's a waiver
of some of your rights.

165
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,803
You should read it carefully.

166
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:53,305
It releases the company in
the event that our relationship,

167
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,141
in your opinion or in reality,
interferes with work.

168
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,228
You get a copy, I get a copy
and a third copy goes to HR.

169
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,523
Awesome. I'm gonna frame mine.

170
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,441
I could frame yours, too.

171
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,402
You realize this is...
This is a legal document

172
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,612
that says you can't
sue the company...

173
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,906
Over our love.

174
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,119
I've never told you
that I love you.

175
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:18,539
You don't have to, Jan.
This contract says it all.

176
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:22,626
I am taking a calculated risk.
What's the upside?

177
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,087
I overcome my nausea,
fall deeply in love,

178
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,589
babies, normalcy,
no more self-loathing.

179
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,551
Downside?

180
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,011
I date Michael Scott publicly

181
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,221
and collapse in on myself
like a dying star.

182
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,018
What's this over the "I"?

183
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,144
It's a heart.

184
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:44,857
Why is this so hard?

185
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,446
That's what she said.
Oh, my God, what am I saying?

186
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,990
I love this woman!

187
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,116
Oh, God.

188
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,326
Michael, please.
Michael, please.

189
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,872
Do you ever watch
Battlestar Galactica?

190
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,207
No? Then you're an idiot.

191
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,876
Hello, Michael.

192
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,920
Rachel! Boy,
you clean up good.

193
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,923
The place looks great with
all the lights on and everything.

194
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,343
Actually looks bigger with
people in it. It's weird. So...

195
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,512
Jan, glad you could make it.

196
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,181
Oh, of course.
Of course, David.

197
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,099
Do you remember Michael Scott
from the Scranton branch?

198
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,684
Of course, I do.
How are you, Michael?

199
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,895
Jan and I are lovers.

200
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,189
It feels so good
to finally say that out loud.

201
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:28,067
David, can I speak
to you privately

202
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,610
for just a moment, please?

203
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:31,236
Excuse me.

204
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,613
Okay.

205
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,792
No. Actually, one of these
is supposed to be a light.

206
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,251
Oh, sorry.

207
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,172
So did the merger
go smoothly or...

208
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,298
It did.

209
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:54,134
"Like butter."
Mike Myers, SNL.

210
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,011
You should ask Karen.
She was one of them.

211
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,890
I'm the only one left. Everybody
else was either fired or quit.

212
00:09:59,973 --> 00:10:01,892
And there's one in anger
management. - Yeah.

213
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:06,605
But you're great now, right?
We're all great. Aren't we great?

214
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,690
We're good.

215
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,110
Michael,
please stop that, okay?

216
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,694
Can I get anyone anything?

217
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,488
I could go for an appe-teaser.

218
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,615
Martini, please.
Yep, Bagel Bites or something.

219
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,075
Rachel, your house
is beautiful.

220
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,243
Thank you.

221
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,370
What's the square footage?

222
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,997
About 5,000.

223
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,207
Does that include the garage?

224
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,502
Dwight, wow.
That's not appropriate.

225
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:30,295
I don't know.
It's a common question.

226
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,965
David, how much
did this house cost?

227
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:36,760
These old Colonials are great
when they're sound.

228
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,179
I'd love to
take a look around.

229
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,848
I'll show you around, sure.

230
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,558
Cool. Let's start
with the banisters.

231
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:43,684
Hey.

232
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,061
Do you see
that guy behind you

233
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,564
in the blue blazer
against the wall?

234
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:50,190
Yep.

235
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,525
That's Drake.

236
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,111
And just so, you know, I don't
want to be weird or anything,

237
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:56,446
but we used to date.

238
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,701
Okay. Cool.
Thanks for telling me.

239
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,327
And it didn't end well.

240
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,039
Got you. All right.

241
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,754
This was a gift

242
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,048
from Lee lacocca.

243
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,843
Twenty-year-old
single malt Scotch.

244
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:22,806
Here is to Mr. lacocca and his
failed experiment, the De Lorean.

245
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,646
Are you okay?

246
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,190
Yeah. Do you have any ice?

247
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,067
Sure.

248
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,861
How about
some Splenda?

249
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,406
One, two, three! Up Jenkins!

250
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,033
Down Jenkins!

251
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,534
Oh, I think I hear
the quarter over here.

252
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,660
Where?
On this side.

253
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,913
No, it is definitely
under one of these hands.

254
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,206
I, kind of, heard it
on Roy's side too.

255
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,208
No. It is here.

256
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,002
Not here. Not here. Not here.

257
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,503
Not here.

258
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:55,464
Good thing
you didn't listen to me.

259
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:56,590
Yeah. Close one.

260
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,966
Not here.

261
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,801
It's not here.

262
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,304
Okay, it's either
here or here.

263
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,559
Not here.

264
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,102
Oh, yes! Yes!

265
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,605
Nice job.

266
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:12,773
I can read you like a book.

267
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:13,857
Oh, yeah?

268
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,359
You can't keep
anything from me.

269
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:18,820
Bottoms up!

270
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,614
Hey, Creed.
Hey!

271
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:22,658
What's up, Creed?
What do you guys up to?

272
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,868
Hello.

273
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,495
You're the man, buddy.

274
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:30,666
I run a small fake ID company from
my car with a laminating machine

275
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,834
that I swiped
from the sheriff's station.

276
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:39,299
Yeah, these studs
are way too far apart.

277
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,136
What's in here?

278
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,763
That's a guest room.

279
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,640
Just the one window?

280
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,394
Oh, I must get that.
You'll have to excuse me.

281
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:51,937
Are those real pearls?

282
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,438
Yes. They're...

283
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,409
Good.

284
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:08,662
Well, it was nice meeting
you guys. Take care.

285
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:13,083
Well, if you're wondering why
his wife was staring daggers at me,

286
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,712
it's because I kind of saw him for a
little bit when they were separated.

287
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,588
Oh, didn't notice.

288
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,632
Really? I thought
it was so obvious.

289
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,926
I'm glad it didn't
make you uncomfortable.

290
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,096
No, it was before I
knew you, so it's fine.

291
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,058
This one really smells
like vanilla. Check that out.

292
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,226
That's nice.

293
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,353
You and the missus
should join us

294
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,064
in Sandals, Jamaica
next Christmas.

295
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,817
Michael, I think
David probably wants

296
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,610
to spend Christmas here
with his family.

297
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,697
Yeah. They don't
allow kids at Sandals.

298
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,451
They are persona
non grata there.

299
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,412
Oh, but it's fun.
It is an awesome place.

300
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,831
You would not believe
how low this girl can limbo.

301
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:54,458
It's crazy.
David, I'm sorry,

302
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,918
you're just going to have to
excuse us for just a couple minutes.

303
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,879
Sorry.
Okay. Okay.

304
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:01,131
Excuse me. What's going on?

305
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:02,549
What is it?

306
00:14:02,632 --> 00:14:03,675
Sorry.

307
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,969
What's... What's the matter?

308
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,555
What... What did I...

309
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:09,890
Come on.

310
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:12,100
Just... Just... Just...

311
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,273
What are you doing?

312
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,233
Don't you know what I'm doing?

313
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,695
Yeah, but you could tell me.
Wow. What... What is that?

314
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,239
Why are we... Why are
we going in the bathroom?

315
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,283
I thought this was
where you liked your privacy.

316
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,618
Shut up.

317
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,705
What has gotten
into you? No, no, no.

318
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,831
What?

319
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,291
Come on, let's get back
to the party. Come on.

320
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,293
Wait, let me just take my dress
off. We're missing everybody.

321
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,878
Don't take that...
No, stop it! Stop it!

322
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,963
Jan! No! No! No!
Michael...

323
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,757
No means
"Please don't."

324
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,550
Means... Slam me up
against the wall right here.

325
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,094
I'm not going to slam you up
against anything.

326
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,388
You're acting inappropriate,
Jan. I want you so...

327
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,972
I'm acting inappropriate?
Yeah.

328
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,266
Forget it.
Get out of my way.

329
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,189
Here.

330
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,482
Hey!

331
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:01,733
Where have you been all night?

332
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,944
I was looking forward
to hanging out with you.

333
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:05,028
I was...

334
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,906
Hey, don't you have
a daughter?

335
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,700
Yes.

336
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,668
Oh, good. You're up.

337
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,044
Hey, who makes this chair?

338
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,131
I don't know.
It was here when I was born.

339
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,425
I want one.

340
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,844
It's really good, solid
construction. It's comfortable.

341
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:31,304
What is this, oak?

342
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,932
I don't know.

343
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,976
What do you know?

344
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,070
God, I hate these parties.

345
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,448
You wanna sneak out back
and shoot some hoops?

346
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,704
Meet me outside
in two minutes.

347
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,081
Now you stay here and have fun

348
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,251
'cause I'm going to go out back
and shoot hoops with David Wallace.

349
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,461
Okay.

350
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,214
Don't mention
that you and I are dating

351
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,467
'cause I think he might
still have feelings for me.

352
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,801
Wallace?

353
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,305
What the hell? Have you
dated, like, every guy here?

354
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,687
Wow.

355
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,105
Okay.

356
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,231
You got me.

357
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,774
I so got you.

358
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,109
So none of them?

359
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,277
Of course not.

360
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:30,989
I mean you're,
kind of, like, my first.

361
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,366
Really?

362
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,868
Oh, my God, it's so easy...
Okay.

363
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,786
...it's not even fun.

364
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:40,999
Hey, Jan.

365
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,167
Not too good.

366
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,381
Did you get a chance to try
Michael's homemade potato salad?

367
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,800
Rachel thinks that I
brought homemade potato salad.

368
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,179
But I just picked it up at
the supermarket. It's funny.

369
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:56,223
I wish I could make
potato salad that good.

370
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,475
It's just potatoes
and mayonnaise.

371
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,810
There's something wrong
with Jan.

372
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,396
What's...

373
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:05,941
What's with Jan and Michael?

374
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,654
I don't know...
Where to begin.

375
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,709
My ball.

376
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,379
The chimney's in decent shape.
Not great.

377
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,256
I found some termite damage
in a crawl space

378
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,008
and some structural flaws
in the foundation.

379
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,511
So, all in all,

380
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,306
it was a pretty fun
cocktail party.

381
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,061
What?

382
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:44,354
I want us to make it.

383
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
I want a fresh start.

384
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,109
That's awesome.
That's what I want.

385
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,696
Okay, but in order
for us to make it,

386
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,073
there can't be any secrets
between us.

387
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:57,200
I didn't...
I didn't do anything.

388
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,036
Ask anybody. I totally
could have and I didn't at all.

389
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,538
Just listen.

390
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,499
Remember that casino night
about a month

391
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,751
before we were supposed
to get married?

392
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,877
I kissed Jim.

393
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,297
What?

394
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,381
He told me how he felt

395
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,133
and I guess
I had feelings, too.

396
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:14,384
And we kissed.

397
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,468
Jim came on to you?

398
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,553
Just listen.

399
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,972
No, I am listening! That's
the problem, I'm listening!

400
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,056
Don't yell.

401
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,474
Don't yell?

402
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,272
This is over.

403
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:29,482
Yeah. You're right.
This is so over!

404
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,402
Are you kidding me, Pam?
Come on!

405
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:35,196
God!

406
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,533
Stupid jet skis!

407
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,832
Our first fight.

408
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,379
If this is about
what happened in the bathroom,

409
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,881
there was no place
to cuddle...

410
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,466
I feel sick.

411
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,218
You didn't have any of
the potato salad, did you?

412
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,597
You know, we were good when we
were just running around, you know?

413
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,642
In secret. It was wrong
and it was exciting,

414
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,729
and maybe it was a mistake
to take it public.

415
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,861
Well, if that's the way
you feel, my lady,

416
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,696
then you have hurt me greatly.

417
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,615
Michael...
Greatly.

418
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:19,908
Please don't cry.

419
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,201
I'm not going to cry.

420
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:24,037
I feel like it,
but I am not going to.

421
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,498
Why don't you just take
your stupid love contract

422
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,749
and tear it up
into a million pieces?

423
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:29,793
It was never a love
contract, Michael. Yeah.

424
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,461
And besides, I have
already given a copy to David.

425
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:33,505
It would be just as embarrassing
to get it back from him

426
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,423
as it was handing it to him...
I want the house, Jan.

427
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,092
I want the picket fence.

428
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,929
I want the ketchup fights and
the tickling and the giggling.

429
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,351
I didn't mean it, okay?
I was...

430
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,435
Whatever.

431
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,190
I was tired. I'm tired and I didn't eat
enough. And that's all. That was it.

432
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,234
That's it. You didn't mean it.
That's all. No, I didn't.

433
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,568
That's all. So...

434
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,570
I'm just saying
I didn't mean it.

435
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,780
Okay. Fine.

436
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:03,326
I love you, Jan.

437
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,452
Okay.

438
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:11,501
Don't break up, you guys.

439
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,131
You're great together.

440
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,517
Are they gonna call the cops?

441
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,935
No. I paid them off.

442
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,856
Jet ski money?

443
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:34,023
All of it.

444
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,235
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
