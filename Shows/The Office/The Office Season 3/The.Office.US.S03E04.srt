1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,629
Hey, Ryan,

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,589
can I get you a pencil
from the warehouse?

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,299
Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

4
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,426
Well, it's okay.
I'm going down.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:14,805
Yeah. Absolutely.

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,724
All right, I'll be right back.

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,611
Awesome.

8
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:29,820
Thank you.
You're welcome.

9
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,448
Michael, could you get me a
pen from down in the warehouse?

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,283
Don't mind if I do.

11
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:37,119
See you in a minute.

12
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,329
Okay!

13
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,341
There you go,
fresh from the warehouse.

14
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:53,594
Hey, Michael, would you get me
some coffee from the warehouse?

15
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,971
There's coffee
in the kitchen, Pam.

16
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,390
But the warehouse coffee
tastes so much better.

17
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:58,641
Yeah. It's better.

18
00:00:58,724 --> 00:00:59,976
Okay. Great.

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,520
All right, okay.

20
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:18,077
I am like Bette Midler in For The
Boys. Gotta keep the troops entertained.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,753
With cream and sugar?

22
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,090
All right.

23
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,792
So, I wanted to let you
know that we lost Ed Truck.

24
00:02:07,543 --> 00:02:10,630
Okay, let me see
if I have his cell.

25
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,257
Is this the only reason
you are calling, Jan,

26
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,550
or does somebody miss me?

27
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,511
Michael Ed died
over the weekend.

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,181
Oh, wow.

29
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:21,807
Attention, everybody!

30
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,809
I just received
a call from corporate

31
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,647
with some news that they felt
that I should know first.

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,191
My old boss,
Ed Truck, has died.

33
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:35,821
Oh, Michael, that's such terrible
news. You must feel so sad.

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes, I am. It's very sad,

35
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,287
because he was my boss.

36
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,998
Oh, that's a shame.
Ed was a good guy.

37
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,168
That's right. You worked
with him. So did Creed.

38
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,004
Well, I'll be in my office

39
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,048
in case anybody
wants to drop by,

40
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,925
cheer me up.

41
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:08,145
So, did you hear the news?

42
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,856
The news that you just
announced, that Ed died?

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,983
Yeah.
Is there anything I can do?

44
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,570
Oh, gosh. What can
anybody do, really? It's...

45
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:19,865
He was almost 70.
Circle of life.

46
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,951
Yeah.

47
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,790
Oh, okay.

48
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,797
Yeah.

49
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,590
Okay.

50
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,677
What's going on
with Fairfield County Schools?

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,345
Karen, did you generate
that price list?

52
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,306
Shoot. I will. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,935
Okay, just get it done.
Jim, will you make sure?

54
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,354
Oh, yeah, definitely.

55
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,232
Suck up!

56
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,151
Josh, did you hear
what I said?

57
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,819
Thank you, everyone.

58
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,492
Damn it.

59
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,661
What's up?

60
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,873
Oh, nothing. We're
just out of Herr's chips.

61
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:09,999
Oh.

62
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,500
But don't worry about it.

63
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,795
My snack food doesn't fall under
the umbrella of your authority.

64
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,715
That's where you're wrong.

65
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,385
I'm your project supervisor
today

66
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,346
and I have just decided
that we're not doing anything

67
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,183
until you get the chips
that you require.

68
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,685
So I think we should go
get some.

69
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,312
Now, please.

70
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,064
It's a real shame
about Ed, huh?

71
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,274
Yeah.

72
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:37,109
Must really have you thinking.

73
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,235
About what?

74
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,530
The older you get, the bigger
the chance is you're gonna die.

75
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,615
You knew that.

76
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,158
Ed was decapitated.

77
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,076
What?
Really?

78
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,413
He was drunk as a skunk,
he was flying down Route 6,

79
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,666
he slides under an eighteen-wheeler,
pop, it snaps right off.

80
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,126
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,839
That is the way to go.
Instant death, very smart.

82
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:03,177
You know, a human can go on living
for several hours after being decapitated.

83
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,012
You're thinking of a chicken.

84
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,639
What did I say?

85
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,349
That is just
not the way

86
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,018
a Dunder Mifflin manager
should go, I'm sorry.

87
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,813
Alone, out of the blue.

88
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,856
Not even have his own head
to comfort him.

89
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:20,277
So I'm not exactly sure
how to say this...

90
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
Ed was decapitated.

91
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:22,696
What are you doing?

92
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,907
You said you didn't know
how to say it. I didn't...

93
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,497
He was driving on the road
and he went under a truck

94
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,418
and that's when his head
was separated

95
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,296
from the rest of him.

96
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,092
Now, we'll let you know more
as soon as I find out.

97
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,305
Hi.

98
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,600
If My head ever comes off, I
would like you to put it on ice.

99
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,061
I do not want
to talk about this.

100
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,648
When I die,
I want to be frozen.

101
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,360
And if they have to freeze me
in pieces, so be it.

102
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:05,239
I will wake up stronger than ever
because I will have used that time

103
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,825
to figure out exactly
why I died

104
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,869
and what moves I could have
used to defend myself better,

105
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,538
now that I know
what hold he had me in.

106
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,331
I don't understand.

107
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:19,545
We have a day honoring Martin
Luther King, but he didn't even work here.

108
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,090
I understand how
you feel, Michael, I really do.

109
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,343
So would it be helpful
to give everyone the day off?

110
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,138
You really don't get it, do you?
You don't understand these people.

111
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:32,808
That is the last thing that
they would want, is a day off.

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,019
Well, what would you suggest?

113
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,395
A statue.

114
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,272
Of Ed?
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,774
I'm not sure that's realistic.

116
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,278
Well, I think it would be very
realistic. It would look just like him.

117
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:45,404
No, that's not...

118
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,530
We could have
his eyes light up.

119
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,740
Could have his arms move.

120
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,992
That is not a statue.
That is a robot.

121
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,827
I think that is a great way
to honor Ed.

122
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,495
And how big
do you want this robot?

123
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,705
Life-size.

124
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:58,709
No. Better make it two-thirds.
Easier to stop if it turns on us.

125
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,836
What the hell
are you two talking about?

126
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,589
Well, we are talking about
how to properly honor

127
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,468
a man who gave his life as regional
manager of this company, Jan.

128
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,346
You know what, Michael, I
have really tried with you today

129
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,680
and I have
to get back to work.

130
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,806
Oh, do you?

131
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,892
You know who wished they
could get back to work is Ed Truck.

132
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,644
So call me when you feel
like... But Ed Truck can't...

133
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,355
...having a real conversation.
Goodbye. ...because he is dead!

134
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,778
Look, I gave him a 6-foot
extension cord so he can't chase us.

135
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,529
That's perfect.

136
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,241
Okay, that is a "no"
on the West Side Market.

137
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,329
Okay, great. I think that's enough.
Can I get back to work now?

138
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,497
Wow.

139
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,041
Never pegged you
for a quitter.

140
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,210
I am not a quitter. I will
do this all day if you want.

141
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,336
Really? I don't know
about that.

142
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,504
Yeah, all day.

143
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,507
What are we doing?
What's the game? I want in.

144
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,176
Oh, there's no game. We're just
trying to get these chips for Karen.

145
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,720
Did you check
the vending machine?

146
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,932
Oh, the vending machines.
How did we miss that?

147
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,433
I have no idea.

148
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,143
We went right for the copier.

149
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,354
And then we checked the fax
machine. Yeah, nothing there.

150
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,107
Did you check your butt?

151
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,237
Can you imagine
how much blood there was?

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,907
If it happened right here, it would
reach all the way to reception.

153
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,158
Probably get on Pam.

154
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,243
Okay, that's enough.

155
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,370
What? We do not
want to hear about this.

156
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,622
Well, you know what? I didn't
want to hear about it either, Stanley,

157
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,500
but I did and now
I can't stop picturing it.

158
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,255
He leaves work, he's on his way
home... His cappa is detated from his head.

159
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,424
You have just spit on my face.

160
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,467
Well, you know what, there's
something wrong with you.

161
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,262
There is something wrong
with everybody in here

162
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:34,972
because we have lost

163
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,100
a member of our family and
you don't want to talk about it.

164
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,645
You don't want to think about it,
you just want to get back to work.

165
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,897
There are five stages
to grief,

166
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:49,236
which are denial, anger, bargaining,
depression and acceptance.

167
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,741
And right now, out there,
they are all denying

168
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:59,955
the fact that they're sad, and that's
hard, and it's making them all angry.

169
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:05,794
And it is my job to try to get them
all the way through to acceptance

170
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,339
and, if not acceptance,
then just depression.

171
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,842
If I can get them depressed,
then I'll have done my job.

172
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,972
I am going
to throw you this ball.

173
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,183
When you catch the ball,
I want you to say

174
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:24,772
the name of a person very important to
you, somebody really special, who died,

175
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,483
and then I want you
to say how they died.

176
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,443
And you may cry if you like.

177
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:32,780
That is encouraged. Let me just
start. Let me show you how this works.

178
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,531
I catch the ball.

179
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,992
I lost Ed Truck

180
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,953
and it feels like somebody
took my heart

181
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:44,374
and dropped it into a bucket
of boiling tears.

182
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,877
And, at the same time,

183
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,006
somebody else
is hitting my soul

184
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,260
in the crotch with
a frozen sledgehammer.

185
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,932
And then a third guy walks in and
starts punching me in the grief bone.

186
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:03,435
And I'm crying,
and nobody can hear me

187
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,108
because I am terribly,
terribly, terribly alone.

188
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Excuse me, I'm sorry to
interrupt. I need to see Pam.

189
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:16,281
There seems to be, like, something
wrong with the radiator in her car.

190
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,367
Okay, fine, hurry back.

191
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,538
There's nothing wrong
with your car.

192
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:26,375
Just thought you might want a break
from the grief counseling session.

193
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,794
Oh, I would like a break.

194
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,671
How are you
liking the new car?

195
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:31,797
Great.

196
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,965
Yeah?

197
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,009
It sure is small.

198
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,303
Got air bags?

199
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,596
I think so.

200
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,142
I don't know. I was mainly
focused on the cup-holders.

201
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,146
Well, you still aren't
driving so fast, are you?

202
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:48,856
Yeah.

203
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:55,028
Hi, yeah. This is Mike
from the West Side Market.

204
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,991
Well, we had a shipment
of Herr's Salt ♪ Vinegar Chips

205
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,244
and we ordered that about
three weeks ago and haven't...

206
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,453
Yeah.

207
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:09,459
You have the in the warehouse?
Great. What is my store number?

208
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,629
Six.

209
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:16,008
What? No. I'll call you back.

210
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,509
Shut up.
Six?

211
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,763
Okay, we can start.

212
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,474
You waited for me?
Yeah.

213
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:29,062
Pam, you're a member of this family,
so we will wait for our family members.

214
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,272
Phyllis, you want
to give it a shot?

215
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,940
I got it.

216
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,109
When my mother
was pregnant with me,

217
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,237
they did an ultrasound and
found she was having twins.

218
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,532
When they did another
ultrasound a few weeks later,

219
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:46,496
they discovered that I had
resorbed the other fetus.

220
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,876
Do I regret this? No. I believe
his tissues made me stronger.

221
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,755
I now have the strength of a
grown man and a little baby.

222
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:58,175
Okay, why don't you throw
the ball to somebody else?

223
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,301
Nope.

224
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,594
Oh, yes, Stanley, come on.

225
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,803
Your turn. You have to go.

226
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,222
I will not.

227
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,640
Okay,

228
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,352
I'm going to toss the ball
to Pam.

229
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,230
Let's see.

230
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,191
I had an aunt that
I was really close to.

231
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:17,277
She was
this amazing female boxer.

232
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:22,407
Anyway, she was injured in a
fight, and she was paralyzed.

233
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,410
So you can imagine
how upset I was

234
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,792
when I found out that she asked her
manager to remove her breathing tube

235
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,502
so she could die.

236
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,255
Wow.

237
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,925
If you want to cry,
that's okay.

238
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,223
Thanks.

239
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,227
A few years ago, my family
was on a safari in Africa,

240
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,774
and my cousin, Mufasa, was...

241
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:59,528
He was trampled to death
by a pack of wildebeests,

242
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,658
and we all took it
really hard.

243
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,621
All of us kind of in the
audience of what happened.

244
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,082
Do you want
to talk about it any more?

245
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:16,211
Oh, it would probably take me, like, an
hour and a half to tell that whole story.

246
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,548
Me, me. Me, me, me.
Me, me. Yes. Okay.

247
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:26,680
I was trying to throw this party once,
and everyone was over for the weekend,

248
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:30,726
and then my Uncle Bernie died.

249
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:36,023
And so, me and my best friend,
we had to pretend

250
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,859
like he was alive, so...

251
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,569
Wait a second.

252
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,947
That's Weekend at Bernie's.

253
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,992
Do you think that
this is a game?

254
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, there is a ball...

255
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,411
All right.
We're starting over.

256
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,579
No, I'm done.

257
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:52,539
You are not leaving!
No, we are not done!

258
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,166
We really have
a lot of work to do.

259
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:55,709
Yeah, well, you know what?

260
00:13:55,792 --> 00:14:01,006
The guy who had my job
has died and nobody cares!

261
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,050
And he sat at my desk.

262
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,844
Michael, look,

263
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:09,222
I know this is hard for you,
but death's just a part of life.

264
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,226
I mean, just this morning I saw a little
bird fly into the glass doors downstairs

265
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,311
and die

266
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,854
and I had to keep going...

267
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,272
How do you know?
What?

268
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,358
That that bird was dead?

269
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:20,901
Did you check its breathing?

270
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,110
It was obvious.

271
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,405
Was its heart beating?
Toby, did you check it?

272
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,574
No, of course you didn't.
You're not a veterinarian!

273
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,743
You don't know anything!

274
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,328
Michael!

275
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,621
Michael?

276
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,333
Michael.

277
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,921
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

278
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,006
Oh, my God! Come on.

279
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,841
Poor little fella.
Oh, shoot!

280
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,676
He's a goner.
No, he's not.

281
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,011
Yeah.
No, he's not.

282
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,680
Michael, get him away from your head!
He is covered in germs and bacterial

283
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,141
No! You can't get diseases
from a bird!

284
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:56,728
A dead bird should not be
in the kitchen.

285
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,854
We don't know if it's dead.

286
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,607
No. That thing is dead.

287
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,734
You want me to flush him?

288
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,862
Attention, everybody.

289
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,199
This will only take
a second of your time.

290
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:14,663
Today at 4:00 p.m., we will
be meeting in the parking lot

291
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,958
to have a funeral service
for this bird.

292
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,709
I have a lot of work to do.

293
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,839
Well, I'm sorry to
inconvenience you, Meredith,

294
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:28,427
but that is what you do when
things die. You honor them.

295
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,680
Toby killed this bird and
now we are going to honor it.

296
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,432
But...
No! No! No! That's enough!

297
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,769
You know what? This
bird is dead. He died alone.

298
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,897
The least you can do
is be there for him now.

299
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,027
Find a box for him.

300
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,780
I'm calling a supermarket
in Montreal.

301
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,031
Nice.

302
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,543
Nope.

303
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,128
Sounded good.
Thanks.

304
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:14,556
It's okay. It's okay.

305
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:21,188
Yes, I know, I know. It's been a
tough day, but it's good to let it show.

306
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,608
I mean, how many times do I
have to confirm plans with Ryan

307
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,027
for him to know
that we have a date tonight?

308
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,741
God!

309
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:33,867
What are...

310
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:35,869
What are you doing?

311
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:36,995
What?

312
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:38,788
No, this is about
the right size.

313
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,749
No, God, no! It's not!

314
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:44,419
What is the matter with you?
Is that the beak?

315
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,423
I'm sorry.
I grew up on a farm.

316
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,176
We slaughtered a pig
whenever we wanted bacon.

317
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:54,387
My grandfather was reburied
in an old oil drum.

318
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:58,725
It would have fit if he had
given me another minute.

319
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:03,772
I need a box, I need a box.
A small box.

320
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:05,482
Not too confining.

321
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,650
Is it for the bird?

322
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,109
Yeah.
I have it covered.

323
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,362
Oh, thank you.

324
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,157
If you want to do something
for the funeral. Yes, please.

325
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,034
Maybe you could play a song
on your recorder?

326
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,202
Excellent.
Do you have it with you?

327
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,453
Always.

328
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:25,794
Did I wake up this morning thinking
I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?

329
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,922
You never can tell what your
day here is gonna turn into.

330
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:35,971
Where'd you find them?

331
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:37,931
Where'd I find what?

332
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:49,150
I called the manufacturer, who
referred me to the distributor,

333
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,403
who referred me to the
vending machine company,

334
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:55,323
who told me that they sell them in
the machines in the building next door.

335
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,576
Glad you could all make it.

336
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,077
You told us we had to.

337
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,745
Dwight, do you have the box?

338
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,706
Actually, I have it.

339
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,420
You made this? Wow.

340
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,048
That's... That's very nice.

341
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:16,636
When I was five, my mom told
me that my fish went to the hospital

342
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,558
in the toilet and it never came
back, so we had a funeral for it.

343
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:25,645
And I remember thinking,
"I'm a little too old for this."

344
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,355
And I was five.

345
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,109
I'd also like to say a
few words if that's okay.

346
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,320
Yes.

347
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,865
What do we know
about this bird?

348
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:42,287
You might think, "Not much, it's just
a bird." But we do know some things.

349
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,081
We know it was a local bird.

350
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,669
Maybe it's that same bird that
surprised Oscar that one morning

351
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,171
with a special present
from above.

352
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,673
I remember that.
That was so funny.

353
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,802
And we know how he died,
flying into the glass doors.

354
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,890
But you know what? I don't
think he was being stupid.

355
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,352
I think he just really,
really wanted

356
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,898
to come inside our building
to spread his cheer

357
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,941
and lift our spirits
with a song.

358
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,777
It's not a songbird.

359
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,780
An impression, then. Lastly,

360
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,575
we can't help but notice that
he was by himself when he died,

361
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,954
but of course we all know
that doesn't mean he was alone,

362
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,416
because I am sure that there
were lots of other birds out there

363
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,169
who cared for him very much.

364
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:32,420
He will not be forgotten.

365
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,630
Amen.

366
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:42,389
Just smile for me
and let the day begin

367
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:48,770
You are the sunshine
that lights my heart within...

368
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:53,441
Society teaches us
that having feelings

369
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,779
and crying is bad and wrong.

370
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:03,743
<i>Well, that's baloney,
because grief isn't wrong.</i>

371
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:07,122
There's such a thing
as good grief.

372
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,958
Just ask Charlie Brown.

373
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,758
Let's get back to work.

374
00:20:35,024 --> 00:20:36,359
Guys, get a broom,
let's clean this up.

375
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,739
Grab a broom,
you heard me. Mush!
