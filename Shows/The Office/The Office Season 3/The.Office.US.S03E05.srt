1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,300
Brain teaser. I have two
coins, totaling 15 cents.

2
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,218
One of them is not a
nickel. What are they?

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,095
A dime and a nickel.

4
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,555
No. I said one of them
is not a nickel.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,850
But the other one is.
I've heard that before.

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,143
Okay.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,855
A man and his son get into a car
accident. They are rushed to the hospital.

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,816
The doctor says, "There is no
way I can operate on this boy..."

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,903
"Because he's my son." The
doctor is the boy's mother.

10
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,946
A man is found hanging
from the ceiling...

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,408
He stepped on a block of ice,
hung himself and the ice melted.

12
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,742
A hunter...

13
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,244
It's a polar bear, because
you're at the North Pole.

14
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,412
Damn it!

15
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:13,488
Tell me what
you did yesterday.

16
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,741
Nothing.

17
00:01:16,158 --> 00:01:17,159
Nothing?

18
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,535
Yeah, nothing.
How was your day?

19
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,162
I don't care
how your day was, Michael.

20
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,665
Wow. Well, okay.

21
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:25,834
I don't care how your
day was either, Jan.

22
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,794
I was just asking you
because you asked me.

23
00:01:27,878 --> 00:01:28,920
Why do you set me up
like that?

24
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,006
Tell me what
you did yesterday.

25
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,506
I worked.

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,135
And then I went home
to my condo,

27
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,512
and Carole came over
and we had sex.

28
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,140
Is that what you want to hear?

29
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,268
Never, ever, ever sleep
with your boss.

30
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,188
I'm so lucky that Jan and
I only got to second base.

31
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,232
Hi, Pam.

32
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,692
I'm great.

33
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:51,360
So, Pam, I'd like you
to keep a log

34
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,612
of everything Michael does,
hour-by-hour,

35
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,740
so that we can analyze it
at corporate, okay?

36
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,033
I don't know if I'm...
Thanks, Pam.

37
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:02,537
It's weird. Jan used to treat
Michael like he was a 10-year old.

38
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,831
But lately
it's like he's five.

39
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,417
So, you excited?

40
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:08,543
Yeah.

41
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,504
Very excited?

42
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,299
Yes, I'm very excited.

43
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,260
Extremely excited?

44
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,887
Just very? That's cool.

45
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,223
I have spent
a year here.

46
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,809
And I have to commit
or get out.

47
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,938
So, Dwight's the top salesman
in the company

48
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,733
and he's taking me
on my first sales call today.

49
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,901
And, I'm excited.

50
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:36,029
I am very excited.
Ryan hasn't made a sale yet.

51
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:40,325
But more importantly,
he hasn't made an ally yet.

52
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,954
Is he gonna be a slacker,
loser, wise-ass like Jim was,

53
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,499
or is he gonna join the
Dwight Army of Champions?

54
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,502
So, what if they're
not talking much?

55
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,754
Then does it make sense to
kind of lead the conversation?

56
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:56,842
You know, just till it gets to a point
where they are asking questions?

57
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,226
So where is the sales office?

58
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,813
When you are ready
to see the sales office,

59
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,232
the sales office will
present itself to you.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,611
Your journey begins now.

61
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,036
Hey.

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,204
What?

63
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:27,914
My chair's squeaking.

64
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,082
Is it?

65
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,333
You took my chair.

66
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,836
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,506
I took back the chair that you took
from me, but I didn't take your chair.

68
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,259
When you get up, I'm just
gonna take it back anyway, so...

69
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,511
So I guess I can't get up?

70
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:02,403
Hey, Coselli. The Cos, Cosby.
Hey, hey, hey!

71
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,119
I love Jell-O Pudding Pops.

72
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:09,039
My son, Theo, loves
Jell-O Pudding Pops, too.

73
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,669
Do you know
where we are, temp?

74
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,379
I know where we're not.

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:19,341
I hold in my hand
a beet seed. Take it.

76
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,387
When you...

77
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,431
Damn it.

78
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:32,729
Hey, Big Tuna, can I
talk to you for a second?

79
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:34,231
Sure.

80
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,735
Can you stand up
and talk to me over there?

81
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:44,074
That's it? That's what
you came up with?

82
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,117
I am acting my heart out here.

83
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,203
Really?

84
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:48,287
Yeah, really.

85
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,830
You asked for my help,
so I helped.

86
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,505
Attention,
Scranton Business Park.

87
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,132
There will be
complimentary pretzels

88
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,593
available in the lobby
from now until 4:00,

89
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:04,803
as a thank you
to our loyal tenants.

90
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,229
Once a year,
they bring in a little cart,

91
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,814
and they give away
free pretzels.

92
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:17,941
It's really not a big deal.

93
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,444
To some people it is.

94
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:24,114
Productivity is important,
but how can I be productive,

95
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,659
if I have this one little thing in
my brain that I cannot get out?

96
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:30,287
And that one little thing
is a soft pretzel.

97
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,997
So, I'm just gonna have
my soft pretzel,

98
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,041
I'll get to work and
I'm gonna be super-productive.

99
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:35,250
Look out for me!

100
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,171
Oh, come on.

101
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,352
And just as you have planted
your seed in the ground,

102
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:56,521
I am going
to plant my seed in you.

103
00:05:57,898 --> 00:05:59,274
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

104
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,984
It smells pretty bad,
doesn't it?

105
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,152
Uh-huh.

106
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:06,736
It's called bull crap and a client
can smell it from a mile away.

107
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,408
Gotcha.

108
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:11,703
Oh, hey, I forgot something
in my car. I'll be right back.

109
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:13,663
Okay.

110
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,970
Of course.

111
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:35,227
I wake up every
morning in a bed that's too small,

112
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,646
drive my daughter to a school
that's too expensive.

113
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,191
And then I go to work to a
job for which I get paid too little.

114
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:45,487
But, on pretzel day...
Well, I like pretzel day.

115
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,656
"Cause they were acting
all tough and everything,

116
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,866
Uh-huh.

117
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,409
But what they were
rapping about was cupcakes

118
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:51,784
and The Chronicles of Narnia.

119
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,911
God, who invented
cupcakes, right?

120
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
I don't know...

121
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,080
I want to kill them.

122
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,082
Hey, Phyllis,
what are you doing?

123
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,709
I'm just saying hi to Bob.

124
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,168
No, I think
you're cutting in line.

125
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,253
Well, settle down, Scott.

126
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,463
No, I'm not gonna settle down.

127
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,547
No way. Uh-uh.

128
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,715
Get in the back, please.

129
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,090
Boo!

130
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,301
Boo!

131
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,427
Back in line.
Thank you.

132
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,639
That's right.

133
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,099
What a pair of marys.

134
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,726
This is pretzel day.

135
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,435
Hey, Dwight,
you're a great salesman.

136
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,103
Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan.

137
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,689
I'll make you kneel
in cow manure

138
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,566
and I'll abandon you
in a beet field.

139
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,486
Oh, that sounds great, Dwight.
I really appreciate that.

140
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,821
Thank you so much. A mentor...

141
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:34,786
Congratulations,
resourceful salesman.

142
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:40,621
You have passed the second
challenge. Welcome to Schrute farm!

143
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,599
Love me, love me
Say that you love me

144
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,725
Fool me, fool me

145
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,810
Stop.

146
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,145
Go on and fool me

147
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,940
Love me, love me
Say that you love me...

148
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,733
This is not fair. It's gonna
be in my head all day. Please.

149
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,779
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

150
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,697
Love me, love me
Say that you love me

151
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:13,241
This is not
a proportionate response.

152
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,662
Fool me, fool me
Go on and fool me

153
00:08:17,913 --> 00:08:22,413
I don't care about
anything but you

154
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,380
Whatever happened
to those guys?

155
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:33,053
Michael.
No cuts.

156
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,099
Oh, Pam, just the woman I'd
like to see. You read my mind...

157
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,892
Great, I thought
you might want to

158
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,769
use this time
to authorize some checks.

159
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,312
I thought that maybe
you could wait in line

160
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,688
for me while I go to
the bathroom?

161
00:08:43,772 --> 00:08:44,773
You're an angel.

162
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,692
Hey, why don't you
just go up to your office

163
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:47,984
and get some work done

164
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,069
and I'll bring you a pretzel?

165
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,655
Because I like them a certain
way and if it gets screwed up

166
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,615
then this whole thing's blown.

167
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,283
You know, I just think
that it's really important

168
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,035
that you be productive today.

169
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:01,081
Pam, productivity starts with
patience and determination.

170
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,083
I'll be back.

171
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:14,594
It is time for your next test.
You have planted the beet seed.

172
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,764
You have walked the long,
lonely walk of loneliness...

173
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,975
Look, man,
I was in a frat in college,

174
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,352
so I know what you're doing.
I get it.

175
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,728
You know
what your problem is?

176
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,563
You know why
you haven't made any sales?

177
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:27,231
"Cause you think
you know everything.

178
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,609
You have to trust that
maybe there are other people

179
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,528
that can teach you things.

180
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,905
Are you ready to learn?

181
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,241
Are you ready
for the final test?

182
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,160
Yeah.

183
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,285
Come on!

184
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:44,416
Thank you.

185
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,251
Hi, please tell me you have
a sweet pretzel left.

186
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,711
We do.
Thank God.

187
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,254
And we have
18 different toppings.

188
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,048
We have sweet glaze,
cinnamon sugar,

189
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,466
chocolate, white chocolate,
fudge, M&Ms,

190
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,968
caramel dip, mint chip,
chocolate chip,

191
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,262
marshmallows, nuts,
toffee nuts, coconut,

192
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,930
peanut butter drizzle,
Oreo, sprinkles,

193
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,433
cotton candy bits
and powdered sugar.

194
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,603
Is there any way that
you could do all of them?

195
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:05,770
The works. You got it.

196
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:08,231
All right! Thank you.

197
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,318
Please be seated.

198
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,700
What was that?

199
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,951
Pay no attention
to the spirits

200
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:21,036
that haunt
this hallowed ground.

201
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,038
Is that your cousin Mose?

202
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,164
Yes.

203
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,917
Mose is my cousin
and he lives here.

204
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,752
He will always be
my best friend.

205
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,671
Unless things go well
with Ryan today,

206
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,090
in which case, I won't hang
out with Mose so much anymore.

207
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:38,344
What is the greatest danger
facing Dunder Mifflin?

208
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,680
Outsourcing and consolidation
of competition.

209
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:42,682
Wrong. Flash floods.

210
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:47,683
What is the true cause
of Robert Mifflin's suicide?

211
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,440
Depression?

212
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,067
Wrong. He hated himself.

213
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,736
What is the Dharma Initiative?

214
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:58,823
I can't believe that Ryan is not
back yet. Where could they be?

215
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,325
Sales take a long time.

216
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,119
Oh, my God, I'm so worried.

217
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,287
I'm sure
Dwight will protect him.

218
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,247
I don't know,
Dwight's so weird.

219
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:10,335
He's not weird,
he's just individualistic.

220
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,670
No, he's a freak.

221
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:13,254
You're a freak!

222
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,470
Final question,
young Ryan Howard.

223
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,516
What

224
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:31,147
is Michael Scott's
greatest fear?

225
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,151
Loneliness.

226
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,862
Maybe women.

227
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:40,448
Wrong.
He's not afraid of anything.

228
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,868
Also, I would have
accepted snakes.

229
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:47,121
Fear is what it's all about.

230
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,667
You cannot sell
while undergoing fear.

231
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,253
You need to vanquish fear!

232
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,923
One must wrestle fear
to the ground.

233
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,802
You will now wrestle
my cousin Mose!

234
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,846
No. Okay. It's over,
this is over. Okay?

235
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,181
All right, wrestle him
to the ground!

236
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,723
No. You're a freak.
No, just... It's the final...

237
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,475
I'm not doing this anymore.
It's part of the challenge.

238
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,643
This is over. Goodbye.
Ryan, don't...

239
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,313
Ryan, you don't have to wrestle
him. Ryan, just get in the coffin.

240
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,483
Ryan?

241
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:17,485
Bye, Ryan.

242
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:21,447
He seemed nice.

243
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,117
Where are all the animals?

244
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,501
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I
am sorry. Mose is sorry, too.

245
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:37,084
Look, he sent over a basket with
eggs and some fat-back bacon,

246
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,008
and look,
something he whittled.

247
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:00,444
Are you still mad?

248
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,159
It's just...

249
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,328
Jim and I didn't get along

250
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,082
and I didn't want it to be
that way again.

251
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,502
You know,
I wanted us to be a team.

252
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:18,796
An unstoppable team that
competed against other teams.

253
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,965
Look, that's not
what I wanted, okay?

254
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,009
I just wanted
to go on a sales call.

255
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:26,638
Oh, screw gun, the sales call!

256
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,493
Hey!

257
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:52,288
Hey!

258
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:57,377
Mr. Coselli? Hey, hey, hey,
the Cos. What's going on?

259
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,339
Do we have a deal? Deal or
no deal? Let's make a deal.

260
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,216
So what is the deal?

261
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:07,095
Establish time frames. Keep the
phrase "real dollars" in their heads.

262
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,889
And always keep
the power in the conversation.

263
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:10,932
That's why you're losing them
on the cold calls.

264
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,268
"Cause you say the word
"please" too much.

265
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,353
Wait, can you go back...

266
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,521
Michael always says,
"K-I-S-S."

267
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:20,609
"Keep It Simple Stupid," great
advice, hurts my feelings every time.

268
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,153
Okay, I'm going to
establish time frames.

269
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,278
Good.

270
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,781
I'm gonna put everything
in terms of real dollars.

271
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,865
Right.

272
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:29,075
I'm gonna ask a lot of questions
that all have positive answers.

273
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,994
Then I can say, "That would be
better" or, "We would like that."

274
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,829
That sort of thing.
Exactly, yeah. That's good.

275
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,414
I am going to try
to be confident but not cocky.

276
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, hey everyone!

277
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:42,588
I am officially streamlining
the efficiency of this corporation.

278
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:44,131
Second, I...
Second?

279
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,634
Yes, second, Toby.

280
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,051
Second, I am insisting

281
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,428
on increased accountability
from every single one of you.

282
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,181
Account... Michael,
what is going on?

283
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:52,640
And I will be
taking questions.

284
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,267
Did you have
a lot of sugar today, Michael?

285
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,352
What's on your suit?

286
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,436
Caramel dip.

287
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,104
But, one question
at a time, please.

288
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,565
Phyllis, Stanley,
I want you to switch desks.

289
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,151
I am going to re-organize
and restructure

290
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,238
the physical layout of the
office to maximize everything.

291
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,032
I think we're getting a lot done,
don't you, on paper at least?

292
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,867
And we are, after all,
a paper company, are we not?

293
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,911
Are we not? Are we not?
Are you with me?

294
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,745
Are you with me?
Thank you very much.

295
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,417
They really didn't
like me.

296
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,712
They did not. But they
didn't have to say it to your face.

297
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,132
I don't get it. I don't get
what I did wrong.

298
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,385
Not everything's a lesson,
Ryan. Sometimes you just fail.

299
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:32,805
It's those online paper jerks.
The whole business is changing.

300
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:33,890
You know what?
They're gonna be screwed

301
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,642
once this whole Internet fad
is over.

302
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,562
What are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no!

303
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:40,730
No!

304
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,565
Ryan! Yes!

305
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,861
Ryan the temp, yeah!
Come on! Come on!

306
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,030
Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin!

307
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:51,282
Come on, drive!

308
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,450
You drive!

309
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,332
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam. Oh, hi, Jim.

310
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,793
He's on a sales call.

311
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,754
No message?

312
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,298
Bye, Jim.

313
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,356
Temp! Temp! Temp!

314
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:28,486
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes!

315
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:32,406
Just think, that temp agency
could have sent you anywhere.

316
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,700
I think about that
all the time.

317
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,037
Good night, Pam.

318
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,163
Night.

319
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,291
Hey, what time is it?

320
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,459
Twenty past five.

321
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,585
AM. or P.M.?

322
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:45,670
P.M.

323
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,046
Oh, good.

324
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,466
These came for you, contracts,
Frank Coselli.

325
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,678
Oh, Coselli, with the Jell-O.

326
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,097
This is a huge sale.

327
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,640
Yes, right, good.

328
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,269
Night, Michael.

329
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,437
Good night.

330
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,402
Dunder Mifflin.

331
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,528
Hey.

332
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,779
Oh, my God.

333
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,948
Hi.

334
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:17,785
I'm sorry, I forgot Kevin's
extension. It's a fantasy football thing.

335
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,787
And I was just gonna go
through the system

336
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,622
'cause I didn't think
you'd be there.

337
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,792
Why are you still there?

338
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,168
I had to work late.

339
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,922
Jan's making me keep a log of
everything Michael does all day.

340
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:32,550
Oh, wow!

341
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,846
Do you think you could
send me a copy of that?

342
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,473
Yeah, totally.

343
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:43,894
So...
So...

344
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,563
Do you...
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

345
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,689
No, I...

346
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,234
Everything's pretty much
the same here.

347
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,526
Oh, good.

348
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,736
A little different.

349
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,780
What time is it there?

350
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,491
What time is it here?

351
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,745
We're in the same time zone.

352
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,872
Yeah, right.

353
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,417
How far away
did you think we were?

354
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,585
I don't know. It felt far.

355
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,466
Yeah, I have a question
for you.

356
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,551
What?

357
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:17,928
How many words per minute
does the average person type?

358
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,180
I type 90.

359
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,515
Shut up.

360
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,851
Mavis Beacon
doesn't even type 90.

361
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,060
It's true.

362
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,645
Okay, I said "average."

363
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:27,939
Seventy? How many do you type?

364
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:30,149
Forget it. I was just
about to brag. Forget it.

365
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:31,400
Come on. Tell me.

366
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,610
No. No.

367
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,112
You have to tell me now.

368
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,279
Sixty-five.

369
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,324
Okay, no need to laugh.

370
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,494
No, that's respectable.

371
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:42,787
Respectable?

372
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,873
So, okay, I'm watching
the movie, by myself.

373
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:46,999
Right.

374
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,877
Because I just wanted
a relaxing evening at home.

375
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:51,295
Okay.

376
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,506
And I'm freaking out.

377
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,632
Yeah.

378
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,551
That movie is so scary.
I know.

379
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,303
But I'm holding on
because I keep

380
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:00,346
waiting for Sandra Bullock
to show up.

381
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,930
No way! How do you confuse
28 Days with 28 Days Later?

382
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:06,560
Because I got it
at Blockbuster

383
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,229
and they don't put
the pictures on the box.

384
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,773
No,
you're making this up.

385
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,692
Would I make that up?

386
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,818
Yes.

387
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,989
Fancy new Beesly would make
that up. New apartment, new stories...

388
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,616
Oh, yeah,
my fancy new apartment.

389
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,286
I have one bedroom,
one bathroom and a closet.

390
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,497
And how many kitchens?

391
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,831
I have one kitchen.

392
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,168
Well, you got totally
taken for a ride, Beesly.

393
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:31,669
It's actually...

394
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,004
Most apartments
these days have like three...

395
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,340
Three kitchens?

396
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:36,465
Yes.

397
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,552
How are you gonna cook every
meal of the day in one kitchen?

398
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,429
Hey, Ryan, are you okay?

399
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,014
Pam?
Yeah.

400
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,599
Yeah.

401
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,767
Pam?

402
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:49,228
Okay, bye!

403
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,731
Oh, yeah,
I should probably go, too...

404
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,982
Oh, no, I was...

405
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,233
I don't know what...

406
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,401
Do you have to go?

407
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,111
Yeah...
No, I should probably go, too.

408
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,196
Okay.

409
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,321
I mean...

410
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,407
Yeah.

411
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,574
Yeah.

412
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,328
Bye, Pam.

413
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,247
Bye, Jim.

414
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,946
Three hundred, sixty-four days
till the next pretzel day.
