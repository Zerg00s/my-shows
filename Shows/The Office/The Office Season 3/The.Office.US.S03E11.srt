1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:04,503
All right,
let's get started.

2
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:07,423
Oh, first off, we're supposed to
be pushing card stock this week.

3
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:10,884
So, let's push
card stock this week.

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,929
Also... What is this?

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,181
Tape recorder.

6
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:17,724
For what?

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,059
For recording.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,229
Michael is on vacation and he
has asked me to record all meetings

9
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,772
and to type up
the transcripts.

10
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:26,775
Okay. Karen,
any news from that law firm?

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,487
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday.
It's a six-month commitment.

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,737
Oh, my God!
Dwight, what are you doing?

13
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:31,905
What?

14
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,033
You're not allowed to take off
your pants in the middle of the office.

15
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:37,494
I'm not. Dwight, you know
what, just back off, okay?

16
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,579
That's making
me uncomfortable.

17
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,790
This is sexual harassment,
by the way.

18
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,624
Oh, my God,
he's got a knife!

19
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,959
I do not have a knife.

20
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,463
No. Let the record show that Dwight
K. Schrute is now completely nude

21
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,299
and is holding a plastic
knife to Stanley's neck?

22
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,219
Let the record show
that Jim Halpert is a liar!

23
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,053
Dwight Schrute is now
wearing a baby's bonnet.

24
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,138
I am not.

25
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,223
Oh, Jim Carrey
just walked in.

26
00:00:57,306 --> 00:00:58,515
Dwight, get his
autograph for Michael...

27
00:00:58,599 --> 00:00:59,683
Jim Carrey did not
just walk in, okay?

28
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,809
Yes, he...

29
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:02,311
Dwight,
what is that on your stomach?

30
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,729
Is that a Muppet Babies
tattoo?

31
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,147
Oh, my God,
Karen, you're right.

32
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,523
That is Animal
from the Muppet Babies.

33
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:07,733
You can't see my stomach...

34
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,320
I am now chopping off
Phyllis' head with a chain saw!

35
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,994
Hey, mon!

36
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:01,912
Hey.

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,956
You have a bunch
of messages and...

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,332
That's nice.

39
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,334
Hannah quit
while you were gone.

40
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,336
I guess she memoed
to file some complaints

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,004
she had about
being a working mother,

42
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:13,507
and so you might
also have to be deposed.

43
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,884
Relax.
Just relax, okay?

44
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:16,969
Okay.

45
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,971
I'll get to all of it later.
It's kind of serious.

46
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:21,307
Aren't you going to
ask me how Jamaica was?

47
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,974
Say it. Ask me.

48
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,228
How was Jamaica?
It was so good!

49
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,648
Hey, mon!

50
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,651
At Sandals, Jamaica, when
somebody says, "Hey, mon,"

51
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,070
everybody says,
"Hey, mon," back.

52
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,072
Oh, Michael,
I'm glad you're here.

53
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,657
Stanley. You know what?

54
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,409
It is really good
to see you, too.

55
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,995
My bonus check was $100
less than you promised.

56
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,331
Okay, well, payroll is
in charge of all of that...

57
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:46,540
They said
I should talk to you.

58
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,292
Well, I am just
getting settled in.

59
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,377
So I'm gonna...

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,336
I am not doing
a lick more work

61
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,712
until I get my
full bonus check.

62
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,966
You are not as much fun
as your Jamaican brothers,

63
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,051
mon.

64
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:01,638
You wanna talk about it?

65
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,931
Nope.

66
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:08,311
I still haven't
found an apartment yet.

67
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,897
I'm living in a hotel.

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,857
Yesterday, I saw a for-rent
sign down the street from Jim,

69
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,778
and he said he didn't think
it'd be such a good idea.

70
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:18,738
He said it would be
like we were living together

71
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,659
in different houses,
two blocks away.

72
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,912
Feelin' hot, hot, hot!

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,415
Feelin' hot, hot, hot!

74
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,127
Feelin' hot, hot, hot!

75
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,256
Feelin' hot, hot, hot!

76
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,133
That's all I know so far,
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

77
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,343
It's good.

78
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:42,929
You know, I had never been
out of the country before now.

79
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,349
I got to see how Jamaicans
live. It is great.

80
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,311
You know, they just relax,
they party all the time.

81
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,646
It's kind of
an impoverished country.

82
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,772
Yeah.

83
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,732
Gosh. Great.

84
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,485
You know what, Pam?
Make a note.

85
00:03:56,652 --> 00:04:01,073
I want us all to start having
piña coladas every day at 3:00.

86
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,825
Well, you can't today.
We're doing inventory.

87
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:05,327
Inventory's at
the end of December.

88
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,287
We couldn't do it without you,
SO we postponed.

89
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,875
I specifically went on
vacation so I would miss it.

90
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,001
Inventory is boring.

91
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:17,047
In the islands, they don't make
you do stuff like take inventory.

92
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,883
Why do you think SO many
businesses move to the Caymans?

93
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:23,387
Tonight, we are going
to have an inventory luau.

94
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,348
I want to bring back
a little slice of paradise

95
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,976
to the Dunder Mifflin
Warehouse Inventory.

96
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,478
So, Party Planning Committee,
get on it.

97
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,897
By the end of the day?
That's impossible.

98
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:36,650
The Jamaicans don't have
a word for "impossible".

99
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,694
Yep, it's English.
It's "impossible".

100
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,488
Michael, there's no
way we can do it in time.

101
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,739
How hard is a luau?

102
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:46,076
All you need are some
grass skirts, pineapple, poi,

103
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,621
tiki torches, suckling pig,
some fire dancers.

104
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,500
That's all you need.

105
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,960
<i>Come on in!</i>

106
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,046
Settle in.

107
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,924
Settling...

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,009
Settling...

109
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,636
And settled. Good.

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,472
There is something I would
like to show everybody.

111
00:05:07,556 --> 00:05:08,557
See this sign?

112
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,393
"No shirt.
No shoes. No problem."

113
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:16,064
This is an attitude I would
like all of you to have right here.

114
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:20,735
So what if we have to stay late
and do inventory? No problem.

115
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,322
Oh, my God. Is that Jan?

116
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:24,406
- What?
- Where?

117
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,949
- What?
- On the left.

118
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,826
No, no, no. That's...
Oh, my God...

119
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,038
No, that's a German woman
named Urgle Grue.

120
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,791
Jan told me to play it cool
and not tell anybody

121
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,085
because it could
get us both in trouble.

122
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,881
So, officially,
I did not see her.

123
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,636
But I did see Jan there

124
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,471
in our room

125
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,057
at night

126
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,642
and in the morning.

127
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:54,227
And that's all I'm gonna say.

128
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,565
Sex. Sex.

129
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,902
We had sex.

130
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,739
I had sex with her.

131
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,324
I had sex with Jan.

132
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,994
Hey, dude.
I just got back from Jamaica.

133
00:06:11,078 --> 00:06:13,538
Big whoop.
I was in Hotlanta.

134
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:15,373
That whole town is waxed.

135
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,876
Yeah, that sounds amazing,
but you know what?

136
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,380
The lady, Jan Levinson,
wanted to go to Montego Bay.

137
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:24,883
You took The Ice Queen?
I don't buy it.

138
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,219
Well, I'm looking at a photo,
right now,

139
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,849
and, I'm telling you,
it could be in Maxim.

140
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,517
They wouldn't give you
a subscription to Maxim.

141
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,020
Oh, no?
No.

142
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,396
Okay. Well,

143
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,358
check this out.

144
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,071
I'm sending you some e-mail.

145
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,407
You got it?

146
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:50,825
What? No, I got nothing.

147
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:53,995
Check it again.
Hit refresh.

148
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,540
Yeah, Mike, still nothing.

149
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,625
Okay, wait a second.

150
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:02,208
I sent it to you at
packer@dundermifflin.com...

151
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,925
Packaging@dundermifflin.com...

152
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,886
Uh-oh.

153
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,888
Wait. I just got it
from somebody else.

154
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,266
Wow!

155
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,726
This is hot. Damn!

156
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,313
How do I get you
out of this picture?

157
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,448
Darryl?

158
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:33,743
Hey. Hi, where's Darryl?

159
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,162
He's in the office.

160
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,371
Okay.

161
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,916
Hi. Hey, man,
how's it going?

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,334
All right.
What's up, Mike?

163
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:42,961
That's great. Okay.

164
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,464
So did you get
an e-mail from me?

165
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,048
Yeah.
Okay.

166
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,386
Well, that was supposed to
go to Packer, not Packaging.

167
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:56,141
Did you already forward it
to a whole bunch of people?

168
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,226
Uh-uh.

169
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,727
Okay.

170
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:02,313
Well, did you get the
second e-mail that I sent

171
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,982
explaining that the first
e-mail was a mistake

172
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,525
and that you
should delete it?

173
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,610
Yep.

174
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,779
Have you sent
that out to everyone?

175
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,905
Mike,
I'm very busy down here.

176
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,784
Yikes.

177
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,952
Already sent it to you,
my friend.

178
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,746
Fantastic.
Boring.

179
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,873
Call me if she rolls over.

180
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,251
Hey.

181
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,335
Hey.

182
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,130
You okay?

183
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:27,214
Yeah.

184
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:32,719
You sure?

185
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:35,180
Yeah. Yes.

186
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,563
I'm just in this, like,
stupid fight with Karen.

187
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,399
Oh!

188
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,861
You want to talk about it?

189
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,990
Really?

190
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,870
I have a special
assignment for you.

191
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,622
Who's the target?

192
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:05,206
A sensitive e-mail has
been released into the office.

193
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,713
It contains a file.
A picture.

194
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,801
The filename is
Jamaica Jan Sun Princess.

195
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,553
What's it of?
Not important.

196
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:16,137
Unless you're willing
to tell me everything,

197
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:17,305
I cannot accept
this assignment.

198
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,932
Okay, then forget it.
Okay, I accept it.

199
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,895
So, I don't know, I just feel like
we've been dating a month, right?

200
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:25,313
Same street, I think
that might be a little close.

201
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:26,564
A little bit much.

202
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:31,152
What?

203
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,616
How far away does she
live now, like, 10 minutes?

204
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,910
Yeah, I guess.

205
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,622
Honestly, I think you
should go easy on her.

206
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,710
No, I didn't mind helping
Jim with his problem.

207
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,796
That's what friends do.

208
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,090
I help Phyllis all the time.

209
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,802
Just yesterday, I untangled
a piece of tape from her hair.

210
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,262
So, yeah.

211
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,228
Hey, thanks a lot.

212
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,899
Oh, don't worry about it.

213
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,902
I mean,
it's better than listening

214
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,861
to Michael
play a conch shell,

215
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,906
which is what I was doing.

216
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,451
Oh, also,

217
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,454
Michael went to
Jamaica with Jan... Yeah.

218
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,706
How have we not
talked about this already?

219
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,459
I mean, what happened there?
Kidnapping?

220
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,837
Hey, I need to talk to you...

221
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,339
Not now, not ever.

222
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:33,631
...about you and Jan.

223
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:35,508
None of your business.

224
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:38,636
I wish that were true,
but it... It...

225
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,722
It seems from that
photo that two of you

226
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,557
have entered into
an intimate relationship.

227
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,101
That photo is my personal
property, and if you are telling me

228
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:47,312
that you went on my computer
and stole that photo,

229
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,106
then I am going
to call the cops.

230
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,150
Michael, nine different
people e-mailed me that photo,

231
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,986
including my ex-wife
and we don't talk.

232
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,822
Well, this is probably
the icebreaker you need.

233
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,741
You know,
for your own protection,

234
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,452
you should disclose
the relationship to HR.

235
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,287
I bet you would
love all the details,

236
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,289
wouldn't you,
you skeevy little perv?

237
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,250
All right. If you're
having a relationship

238
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,376
with your superior,
you must disclose it.

239
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,336
No, no.
No, I am not dating Jan.

240
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,339
She was very clear
about that.

241
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,759
Just two like souls
having a romantic time

242
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,178
in the most
romantic place on Earth.

243
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,805
Got enough, weirdo?

244
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,766
All right, thanks, Michael.
Okay.

245
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,852
Okay, we only have
three hours, people,

246
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:29,103
to plan a whole luau
and you're not helping.

247
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,356
What are
the ingredients of poi?

248
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,985
I've called every grocery store in
Scranton and no one sells whole pigs.

249
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,694
Did you try
the petting zoo?

250
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,326
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

251
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,202
Just a second. Michael?

252
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,496
It's Jan on the phone.
Oh, God!

253
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,915
No, no, no. Hang up. Hang up.

254
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,460
Tell her I'm not here.
Don't... Don't...

255
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,169
I've ran out of gas.

256
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,256
I hit a deer. I hit...
I hit a deer with my car.

257
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,217
No. I hit a cat.
Tell her I hit a cat.

258
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,802
He'll call you back.

259
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,804
Okay. Great.

260
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,682
Do you think she bought it?
Okay.

261
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,727
Okay.

262
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,105
Michael hit a deer?

263
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,278
Michael! Michael, there's an
emergency in the warehouse.

264
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,571
An accident?
Is somebody hurt?

265
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:20,905
No, it's...

266
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,949
It involves the photograph.

267
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,493
Oh, God! No, no, no.

268
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,338
Mike,
you're a rock star, man!

269
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,215
You are the man!

270
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,508
Yeah!
Well done!

271
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,302
All right. Okay.

272
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,929
Hit that corporate booty.

273
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,388
Nice to hit it!

274
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,313
Hello! Hi!
Attention, everyone.

275
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:57,483
Apparently, there is an
e-mail circulating around

276
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,821
that contains a very PG-13
rated picture of me and a woman.

277
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,031
Jan.

278
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,159
No, Kevin, a woman.
Maybe Jan, maybe...

279
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,244
Urgle Grue.

280
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,996
My point is
that if you get it,

281
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,791
I would ask that you just
delete it, sight unseen.

282
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,792
Let's be professional,
all right?

283
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,880
Feelin'...
Feelin' hot, hot, hot

284
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,924
Hey!
Hey.

285
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,592
What are you doing out here?

286
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,135
Island living, you know.

287
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,220
Jan called.

288
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,265
She's coming in
later to talk to you.

289
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,975
Did she say what it's about?

290
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,392
That's all she said.

291
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:48,367
Olé, olé, olé
olé, olé, olé

292
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,830
Olé, olé, olé
olé, olé, olé

293
00:13:51,913 --> 00:13:53,915
The people in the party,
hot, hot, hot

294
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,919
I think you dropped this.

295
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,923
You sure?

296
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,050
Definitely.

297
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:07,553
I have disconnected
the office T1 line.

298
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:08,679
I have ordered
that be taken down.

299
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:09,765
All right.

300
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,559
I've destroyed all printouts
from the bathroom.

301
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,477
There are copies
in the bathroom?

302
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,145
There were a lot of them.

303
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,731
All right.

304
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,572
I think I owe you one.

305
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,907
Sorry?

306
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,825
For talking
sense into Halpert.

307
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,995
The Days Inn Room 228 was
staring to get really depressing.

308
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,705
Yeah, I know,
don't worry about it.

309
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,791
I mean,
he was being ridiculous.

310
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:39,252
Yeah. But thanks, seriously.

311
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,754
Sure.
Okay.

312
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,512
Yes!

313
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,096
Yes, what'd I tell you?

314
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,016
I knew he'd turn up.
You see that?

315
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,436
This is the greatest night
of my life.

316
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,325
Who did this to you?
Where is he?

317
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,452
What?

318
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,206
No. It's not... It's nothing.

319
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,967
It's hot in here.

320
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,887
Yeah.
Yeah.

321
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,065
Thanks.

322
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,821
You don't need to stay here.
I know.

323
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,717
So you're PMSing
pretty bad, huh?

324
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,826
Hello, everyone.

325
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,704
Hello, Michael.
Hello.

326
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,914
Hi, Jan. You look

327
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:41,916
tan.

328
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,670
I was in Scottsdale,
visiting my sister.

329
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,465
Yeah? How was it?

330
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,426
Very sunny.

331
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,469
Family's important.

332
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,098
Michael. I would
like to speak with you

333
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,391
in your office, please.

334
00:16:58,475 --> 00:16:59,684
Okay. Yep.

335
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,388
Why am I here, Michael?

336
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:39,640
In the last year,

337
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:42,893
I've gone through a divorce,
an identity theft,

338
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,731
a husband who
would not communicate.

339
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,816
This is neither
here nor there.

340
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:51,152
My psychiatrist thinks that I have
some self-destructive tendencies,

341
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,821
and that for once,
I should indulge them.

342
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,531
Are you following me?

343
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:56,991
Yes.

344
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,286
I think I owe it to myself

345
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,664
to find some kind of
happiness, you know?

346
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:08,248
I mean, even... Even if it
means lowering my expectations

347
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,005
or redefining
the word itself.

348
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,257
Okay, yeah...
This is the thing, you know?

349
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:17,094
I am attracted to you.

350
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,346
I don't... I don't
know why, I... But I am,

351
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,353
and I need to
follow my instincts.

352
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,231
At least, that's what
Dr. Perry thinks.

353
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:30,733
Who's Dr. Perry? I...

354
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,777
This is the point, okay?

355
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,529
You're wrong for me.

356
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,448
In...

357
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,284
In every way.

358
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,994
But I still...

359
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,078
Well, I...

360
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,581
...find myself wanting

361
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,169
to be with you.

362
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,798
And I to you,

363
00:18:55,884 --> 00:19:00,221
in addition,
feel the same feelings

364
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,266
that you are, as well.

365
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:11,232
Good. Good.

366
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:19,156
So, thanks for coming by.

367
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,241
Yes...

368
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,326
I...

369
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:22,827
Oh. Good.
Okay.

370
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,912
Okay.

371
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,665
Thank you for
taking the time.

372
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,876
Well, thanks for coming over.
I appreciate...

373
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,799
Wait 15 minutes, okay?

374
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,135
Then find an excuse and
meet me at your condo, okay?

375
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,345
Okay.

376
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:44,432
Jan?

377
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,978
You complete me.

378
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,944
Oh, God.

379
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,742
Hey.

380
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,163
You remember when we were
planning our honeymoon,

381
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,084
and you wanted to go to Hawaii
and I wanted to go to Mexico?

382
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:12,877
Yeah.

383
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:16,130
I was definitely right.

384
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,055
Oh, brother.

385
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,892
What am I gonna do?

386
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,186
I'm gonna hang it up at home.

387
00:20:31,187 --> 00:20:33,230
I don't have a lot of art.
