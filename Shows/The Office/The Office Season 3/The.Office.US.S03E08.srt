1
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:09,212
The Stamford branch is closing, and
everybody's just packing up their stuff.

2
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,678
Andy Bernard made
these tasteful hats.

3
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,516
That's the other thing you
have to watch out... Yo, Tuna.

4
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,976
I wanna talk to you about
this new boss, Michael Scott.

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,855
Yeah?
So what's he like?

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,439
Likes, dislikes, favorite sports, favorite
movies, favorite men's magazines.

7
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,279
You know what? I think
you just need to meet him.

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,115
Playing your cards
close to the vest. I get it.

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,536
Good luck over there, Tuna.
Cross me and I will destroy you.

10
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,539
Sounds good, Andy.

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,836
This is gonna be an adventure.
Yes, this is going to be very interesting.

12
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,214
All right, I'm out of here.

13
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,382
See you later?
Bro.

14
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,599
Hey, is that Josh's computer?
What?

15
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:05,063
Hey!
Hey!

16
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,732
How'd the run go?
Pretty good. I finished.

17
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,652
That's great.
Yes.

18
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:11,111
Why is that great?

19
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,738
Because he accomplished
something.

20
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,657
What was your mile time?

21
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,324
About seven.

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,703
I could beat that on a
skateboard. Well, that has wheels.

23
00:01:19,787 --> 00:01:22,247
Yeah, well, my feet don't,
and I can still crush that time.

24
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:24,291
Really, Dwight?
How fast are you?

25
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,667
Let's just put it this way.

26
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:28,503
Last weekend,
I outran a black pepper snake.

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,672
Really?

28
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,006
I am fast.

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,257
To give you a reference point,

30
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,260
I'm somewhere between
a snake and a mongoose.

31
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:37,012
And a panther.

32
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,181
Man, what is taking
Toby so long?

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,100
Oh, I'll just time him later.

34
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:43,852
And you'll compare the times?
Yeah.

35
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,441
Are you ready? Set, go! No,
my groin's really tight, I can't...

36
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,196
Am I being mean to Dwight?

37
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:57,616
I don't know. I did just make
him run around the building,

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,035
and I have no intention
of timing him,

39
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,664
This isn't even a stopwatch.
It's a digital thermometer.

40
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,792
He does make my life harder
sometimes, and on purpose.

41
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,045
Like, he tried to put meters
on the bathroom stalls

42
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,214
as a way of bringing in
more money for the company.

43
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,592
Hey, three more laps to go!

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,387
You gotta pick it up
if you're gonna beat Toby!

45
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,267
I should probably
get back to work.

46
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,597
Here. Who's here?
Nametag?

47
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,307
Yes, please.
Karen Filippelli.

48
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,517
Karen...

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,603
Karen a-Filippelli!
Probably Italian.

50
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,189
Possibly Filipina.
Okay...

51
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:12,941
My branch is absorbing
the Stamford branch.

52
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,404
Or as I like to put it,
my family is doubling in size.

53
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,780
And that's all
I'm gonna say about it,

54
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:22,409
because I have a gigantic
performance ahead of me,

55
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,913
and I have to get into
my head and focus.

56
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,959
Who's next?
That's Andy Bernard.

57
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,585
Andy Bernard.

58
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,462
If I were you...
St. Bernard.

59
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,173
...I would fire Anthony
Gardner... What?

60
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,508
...before noon...
I'm not...

61
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,051
...to consolidate power. I'm not
firing somebody on the first day.

62
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,096
No, no, not somebody. Gardner!

63
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,264
The Japanese camp guards
of World War ll

64
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:48,685
always chose one man to kill whenever
a batch of new prisoners arrived.

65
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,689
I always wondered how they
chose the man who was to die.

66
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,902
I think I would have been good
at choosing the person.

67
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:01,489
Good morning!
Got the food, good!

68
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,993
Looky, looky, looky.
What I want you to do...

69
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,578
Set it up in the conference
room, please. Make it look nice,

70
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,829
as if you were trying
to impress

71
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,331
a much older man
who's way out of your league.

72
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,541
Okay.

73
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:16,584
Yes, I'm in a good mood today. I'm
excited to meet all of the new people

74
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,510
and to see my old
friend again, definitely.

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,762
That's always a thing
that makes people happy,

76
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,430
to have an old friend back.

77
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,433
Hello?

78
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:29,893
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
Our first arrival.

79
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,436
Welcome to Scranton.

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,690
This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr!
Hannah Smoterich-Barr!

81
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,987
Welcome to our humble abode.
Follow me to your desk.

82
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,573
Your ball-and-chain
is right over here.

83
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,745
You know, a lot of these people,
this is the only family they have.

84
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:52,328
So, as far as I'm concerned,
this says, "World's Best Dad."

85
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,503
There he is!

86
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,463
Tony... What's your last name?
Gardner.

87
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:00,382
Gardner! I knew that.

88
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,720
There you go, gift bag
for you. Okay! Thanks.

89
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,597
Michael,
I didn't get a gift bag.

90
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,931
Well, they're just for guests.

91
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:09,641
If there are any left over,
you can buy one later.

92
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:11,059
My bag's mostly pencils.

93
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:15,397
Well, and coupons to various
hot spots around Scranton. All right!

94
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,983
Let me show you
to your area, sir.

95
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,693
Come on, big guy.

96
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,237
Can I have your pencils?

97
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,488
. Hi!

98
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:26,116
I'm Pam.
Karen. I love your sweater.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,410
Oh, thanks.
My mom made it for me.

100
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,038
Really? That's so cool.
I've always wanted to learn

101
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:33,998
how to knit.
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

102
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:39,042
Take me to your leader.
Oh, wait, I am your leader.

103
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,676
Wait, are you a robot
or a Martian?

104
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:49,264
I am actually your boss,
Michael Scott.

105
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,390
Welcome.

106
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:54,227
Wow, you are very exotic-looking.
Was your dad a GI, or...

107
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,199
I'll be the number-two guy
here in Scranton in six weeks.

108
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,452
How? Name repetition,
personality mirroring,

109
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,038
and never breaking off
a handshake.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,248
I'm always thinking
one step ahead,

111
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:19,711
like a carpenter
that makes stairs.

112
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,840
Hello.

113
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:28,887
You must be Andy Bernard.
Aloha and welcome!

114
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:33,554
And you must be Michael Scott.
Aloha and hello.

115
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:39,227
Very good.
Welcome to our little kingdom.

116
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,734
We have a bag
of nifty gifties for you.

117
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,360
Well, Michael, thank you for
welcoming me to your little kingdom. Mike.

118
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,910
Nifty!
They are nifty!

119
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,912
They're nifty gifties.

120
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,498
You know who I really like
is this guy Andy Bernard.

121
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,585
He has got this very
likeable way about him.

122
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,633
...which is why they need
a passing game. Right?

123
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:09,428
No way! Get him out of here. We
don't want any of this kind in here.

124
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,929
Good to see you, man!
Wow, okay!

125
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,432
How are you?
Martin Nash, I presume?

126
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,142
This is a little gift bag
for you free of charge.

127
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,603
Follow me, I will show you
where all the slaves work.

128
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:22,065
Not... So your desk is...

129
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,360
Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.
Oh, my God, it's really you!

130
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:29,072
I was just doing a little joke
there about how we'd never met.

131
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,448
I know, I don't care.

132
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,784
Awesome! Good to be back.

133
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:34,786
The place looks really good.

134
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,289
It's really good to see you.
You, too.

135
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,541
Where do I stand with Pam?

136
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,879
No idea. I mean,
we're friends.

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,925
Always have been friends.
That is where we stand.

138
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,136
Well, well, well.

139
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,972
Look what the cat dragged in
from Stamford.

140
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,099
Hey, Dwight.
Fact.

141
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,978
I am older. I am wiser.
Do not mess with me.

142
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,772
Okay, sounds good.

143
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,816
What are you doing? I don't
know what you're talking about.

144
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,861
Do I have a smudge on my
forehead? No, you look good.

145
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,948
Why are you looking
at my forehead? I'm not.

146
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,492
Meet my eye line, Jim!
I am.

147
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,412
Stop acting like an idiot!
Okay.

148
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,499
Hey, buddy. Welcome back.
Hey.

149
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,584
How are you, man? Good to
see you. I'm good. How are you?

150
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:27,130
So...

151
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,967
Oh, I'm sorry,
are you sitting here now?

152
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,217
Yeah.

153
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,600
Unless you really,
really want it back.

154
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,272
You know, man, it's really
your call. Cool, thank you.

155
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,818
Let me get that for you.

156
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,278
Got it?

157
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,036
This one taken? No? Good.

158
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:03,083
Yeah, Jim is a nice guy.
That's why I got the desk.

159
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:08,213
Michael Scott, thank you.
I appreciate it, Mike.

160
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,964
All right.

161
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,884
Hello. I don't believe
we've been introduced.

162
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,220
Dwight Schrute,
Assistant Regional Manager.

163
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,348
Andy Bernard, Regional
Director in Charge of Sales.

164
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,641
So you'll be reporting
to me, then.

165
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,767
On the contrary.

166
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,145
My title has "manager" in it.
And I'm a director.

167
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:27,774
Which, on a film set,
is the highest title there is.

168
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,401
Do you know anything
about film?

169
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,489
I know everything about film.
I've seen over 240 of them.

170
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:36,032
Congratulations.

171
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,249
Hey, Toby.

172
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,542
Hey, Jim.
How are you, man?

173
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,044
Oh, really good!
I just wanted to say hi.

174
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,295
How are you?
Hey, welcome back.

175
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,672
Oh, is that, like,
your new thing, or...

176
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,759
No, I'm sorry, that's...

177
00:09:53,842 --> 00:09:57,053
No, that's cool. No,
it's nothing, we'll just...

178
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,432
All right. Good to be back.

179
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,809
Okay.
All right.

180
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,603
All right. Sorry about that.
No problem.

181
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,688
It was...
What?

182
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,023
Nothing.

183
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:14,570
"I present
the orientation video."

184
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,407
We need to talk.
Not now.

185
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,284
Which is higher,
Assistant Regional Manager,

186
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,078
or Regional Director
in Charge of Sales?

187
00:10:21,161 --> 00:10:24,038
I told you the titles are irrelevant.
They just relate to pay scale.

188
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,749
Okay, so who gets paid more,
me or Andy?

189
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:30,087
It is not a matter of more or less.
Your pay is just different, okay?

190
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,797
All right! Showtime, part one.

191
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,173
Okay, who reports to who?

192
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:38,637
I don't care, Dwight! You all
report to me. That's all that matters!

193
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,638
The rest of it just work out
amongst yourselves, okay?

194
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:43,391
And then if I want... Work it
out amongst yourselves, please!

195
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,186
I have a company to run. Will
you let me run the company?

196
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,397
Will you? Please? .. One...

197
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,070
Jim!
Kelly!

198
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,156
Oh, my God, I have so
much to tell you! Really?

199
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,743
Yes. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes,
they had a baby and they named it Suri,

200
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,495
and then Brad Pitt
and Angelina Jolie,

201
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,831
they had a baby, too,
and they named it Shiloh.

202
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:09,042
And both babies are amazing!

203
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,711
Great. What's new with you?

204
00:11:11,795 --> 00:11:13,421
I just told you.

205
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:18,134
Okay, everybody settled in?
Good.

206
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,638
Why don't we all proceed
into the conference room,

207
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,434
or should I say
the banquet hall?

208
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,686
For... Drum roll, please.

209
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,609
The official

210
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:37,278
Merger Day All-Family
Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!

211
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't be shy.

212
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,535
Hey, champagne.
No, no, guests only.

213
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,206
Smoked salmon!
No, for the guests it is,

214
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,000
for you, consider it cow meat.

215
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,043
Strictly taboo.
I eat beef.

216
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,546
Well, then,
consider it poisoned beef.

217
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,672
It's no touchee.

218
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,341
The beef is poisoned?
No, it's not beef! Just...

219
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:01,469
Sit down, please.
Welcome, help yourself.

220
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,222
You might want
these orientation materials.

221
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,934
Wrong, Toby, this is an
orientation, not a bore-ientation.

222
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,437
Okay, do not worry. All of your
questions are about to be answered.

223
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,526
Cell phones and pagers off,
please.

224
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,029
Oh, this looks promising.
You won't be disappointed.

225
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,907
Let's face it, moving
to a new job can be very stressful,

226
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:27,491
so I have made an orientation
video especially for you newcomers.

227
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:32,788
But it's not like any orientation
video that any of you have ever seen.

228
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,170
It's funny.

229
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,466
It's got a little bit
of a zing to it.

230
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:42,593
And I hope
that it gives you a flavor

231
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,681
of what we're all about
here at Dunder Mifflin,

232
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,641
and what we're all about
here in Scranton.

233
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,894
So let's just all laugh
together. And watch...

234
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,608
Sittin' in my office
With a plate of grilled bacon

235
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,111
Call my man Dwight
Just to see what was shakin'!

236
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,529
Yo, Mike,
our town is dope and pretty

237
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:04,449
So check out how we live
In the Electric City!

238
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,951
They call it Scranton!
What?

239
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,536
The Electric City! Scranton!
What?

240
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,912
The Electric City!

241
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,541
Call Poison Control
if you're bit by a spider!

242
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,752
But check that it's covered
By your healthcare provider!

243
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,840
It reminds me of the orientation
video Michael showed on my first day,

244
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,175
The Scranton Witch Project.

245
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,135
I am so scared

246
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:27,513
when people don't
label their personal food.

247
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:30,016
You like coalmines
and you wanna see 'em?

248
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,727
Well, check it out, yo
the Anthracite Museum

249
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:35,104
Plenty of space
in the parkin' lot!

250
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,899
But the little cars go
in the compact spot!

251
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,360
Spot! Spot! Spot!

252
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,156
Well, so far,
I think it is killing.

253
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,824
I thought it would either be
an A or an A-plus,

254
00:13:46,908 --> 00:13:50,411
but I completely forgot
that there is an A-plus-plus.

255
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,997
What?

256
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,043
This is Karen Filippelli,
please leave a message.

257
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,546
Terrible.
Totally unconvincing.

258
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,218
This is Karen Filippelli,
please leave a message.

259
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:09,802
Not bad. But you are
Italian, so try it more Italian.

260
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,772
This is Karen a-Filippelli,
please leave-a me the message.

261
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,734
You feel good? All right.

262
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,240
Karen Filippelli.

263
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,787
Hey, buddy.

264
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,205
Anything new to report?

265
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,958
Do you mean, to me from you?

266
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,170
"Cause that's how it works.

267
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,382
Sure thing, buddy.

268
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,223
Am I trying to get
under his skin? Yes.

269
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,893
Because the angrier he gets, the
more marginalized he becomes.

270
00:14:55,977 --> 00:15:00,477
Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is
out there laying on the charm.

271
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,319
Hey, Angela. Check this out.

272
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,823
It's my new screensaver.

273
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,909
Do you like it?

274
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:13,494
I do like it, actually.
Thank you.

275
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,916
You have such a pretty smile,
by the way.

276
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,086
Thank you.
You're welcome.

277
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,174
Hey.

278
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,884
What happened to grape soda?

279
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,679
Oh, yeah, I'm trying
to move away from that.

280
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,681
Getting into more
of a bottled water phase.

281
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,976
You've changed so much.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.

282
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,689
So when do I get to hear everything?
Are you still getting unpacked, or...

283
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,942
You wanna grab a coffee
or something after work?

284
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,653
Tonight, actually? No, I'm
just still getting settled, so...

285
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,780
Oh, yeah, no, you
know, whenever. Okay.

286
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,700
Okay.

287
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:56,537
Sorry to interrupt, I... Nope,
you're not interrupting anything.

288
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,374
Nope, I'm... Don't.
All right.

289
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,542
Okay.
All right.

290
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,838
I should probably
get back to work.

291
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,551
Crack the whip. All right.
Yeah, I know, me, too.

292
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:17,559
The day's going fine. It's
been a little chaotic, but it's fine.

293
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:22,438
It's great. A lot of
distractions, but it's good.

294
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,989
Take a picture,
it'll last longer.

295
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,949
I'm sorry, it's just...
It's a little distracting.

296
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,910
Ditto that, my brother.

297
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,555
Look what's on his computer!

298
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,849
What is that,
a squid's eye, or...

299
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,684
It's my left breast.

300
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,522
How did you...
Right place at the right time.

301
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,445
Oh, what's that smell?
What smell?

302
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,200
There must be an air freshener
plugged in somewhere.

303
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,618
It smells like a funeral home.

304
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,787
Oh, I'll help you find it.

305
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,543
You know what, never mind.
What is it?

306
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,213
I think I'm just allergic
to your perfume.

307
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,466
My perfume?
It's just my crazy nose.

308
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,887
I'm used
to different smells.

309
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:40,349
Bob Vance bought this perfume
for me in metropolitan Orlando.

310
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,518
It's made from real pine.

311
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,228
Who's Bob Vance?

312
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:47,690
You've a lot to learn
about this town, sweetie.

313
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:52,153
I don't know who these
new people think they are.

314
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,823
I've sat downwind of Phyllis'
stinky perfumes for years.

315
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,784
Never said a word.

316
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:01,203
People hate people that are
different from them. That's natural.

317
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,707
But you know what makes people
forget their differences?

318
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,957
A great show.

319
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,294
That is why I created
the integration celebration.

320
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,671
This is the moment

321
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:12,673
when Scranton and Stamford
come together as one,

322
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,426
united in applause.

323
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,722
I know a lot of you
must be thinking,

324
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,182
"Wow, what a day.

325
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,102
"It feels more like a night at
a party than a day at work."

326
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,270
Well, in my opinion,

327
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:30,649
business should feel
like a night out,

328
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:33,736
a night at

329
00:18:37,073 --> 00:18:38,866
the Roxbury.

330
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,829
Okay, there's supposed
to be music, and it's...

331
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,456
I got it, I got it,
Dwight! Just...

332
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,875
Do you have batteries
in there? Stupid...

333
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,467
What is love?

334
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,343
That's it! Yes, yes!
Okay. Here we go.

335
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,428
Baby don't hurt me

336
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:01,305
Don't hurt me no more
Don't hurt me no more

337
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,390
Let it rock, baby!

338
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,559
What is love?
Baby don't hurt me

339
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,977
Here we go, here we go!

340
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,480
Don't hurt me no more

341
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,816
Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

342
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,030
You and me! You and me!
Me and you! You and me!

343
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,783
You and me! You! You! You!
You! You and me! You! You!

344
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:23,327
Oh, my nose is so itchy.
Why is my nose so itchy?

345
00:19:23,411 --> 00:19:25,913
Probably because of
all the nose candy.

346
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,499
Okay.

347
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,793
I told you these guys had
a sense of humor.

348
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,253
Very funny, Michael!
Okay.

349
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,922
Really funny, Michael! All right,
all right, all right, I'm on a roll.

350
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,133
Why are the new people
on the table?

351
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,887
To show them
that we are not above them.

352
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,932
Shouldn't we be equals?

353
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,100
Not today, no.

354
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:52,144
Tony! Please join your cohorts
on the table, if you would.

355
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,194
This is difficult for me.

356
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,404
Hey, I understand,
we're all friends.

357
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,741
No, I mean, I can't physically.
I can't get on the table.

358
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,159
Oh, well...

359
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,706
Just use the momentum of your
lower half to hoist yourself up.

360
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,418
Okay?

361
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,176
You know what? I'll help.
I will help. No, please.

362
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,470
Don't... Don't be shy.
Dwight, let's do this.

363
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,805
Come on,
we're doing this thing.

364
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,472
Ready? On three. One...
Let's get up.

365
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,101
Bend at the knees. Okay.
Here we go! Here we go!

366
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:31,020
I'm under this.
I'm under this hock here.

367
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,857
I don't know what I'm grabbing
here! All right, all right! Stop!

368
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,233
Put me down! But it
feels good. Push it, push it!

369
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:39,153
I'm right in your crack!
No, put me down right now!

370
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,988
Don't give up! You got it,
man! Put me down right now!

371
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,282
I've had enough! Put me down
right now! You got it, you got it!

372
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:46,243
Wait, wait, wait okay,
okay, okay. Easy. Hey, easy.

373
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:47,953
I'm sorry!
Don't...

374
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:51,665
It's just not going
to work for me.

375
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,585
I have to go.

376
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:54,877
I don't understand.

377
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:57,505
I was on the fence about this,

378
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,799
and it's just not a good fit.

379
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,844
Well, we'll squeeze you in!
I can't work here.

380
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:04,470
I have to quit.

381
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,266
You can't quit on the first
day! That's heresy, my friend!

382
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,150
Okay, let's talk about this.
What happened? I mean, what...

383
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:21,529
Was it Toby? Did he say
something? 'Cause he's...

384
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,575
No, Toby was helpful.
He was very kind.

385
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:29,453
It's just your
management style.

386
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:33,457
My management style? So...

387
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:38,504
Didn't you think Lazy
Scranton was funny? No.

388
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,006
Was it supposed to be funny?

389
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,466
Okay, well...

390
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,887
Don't bother quitting,
because you're fired.

391
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,390
Excuse me?
You are fired!

392
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,351
I'm sorry, but we don't
have quitters on this team!

393
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:53,853
Just clean out your desk!

394
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,897
But there's nothing
in my desk except coupons.

395
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:59,859
Don't try to apologize to me,
man. It's too late! Just get out!

396
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,696
Take your bad vibes with you!

397
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,989
That was my advice.

398
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,824
Remember, I'm the one who
suggested that you fire him!

399
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,201
Probably the best advice
you ever gave me, Dwight.

400
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:13,664
And what advice has Andy given
to you today that you have acted on?

401
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,168
Would none be an accurate
estimate? None advice?

402
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,588
Fire Andy.

403
00:22:21,464 --> 00:22:23,340
Fire Andy.

404
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,719
Dwight may have
won the battle,

405
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,931
but I will win
the next battle.

406
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,476
Tony was right. This
environment is dysfunctional.

407
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,479
Well, maybe that's because
some people treat it

408
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,314
like their own private
Hooters strip club.

409
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,610
Whoa, Angela, hold on.
Hooters is a restaurant

410
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:44,611
with over 400 locations
worldwide.

411
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,824
Back to work. We don't have to get
along. We just have to work together.

412
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:49,867
No, we do have to get along.

413
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,453
Can't we all just get along?

414
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:57,291
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

415
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,626
The word "merger” comes
from the word "marriage”

416
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,046
and that was what today was
supposed to be.

417
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,966
The loving union
between people.

418
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:09,549
Instead, it has become like
when my mom moved in with Jeff.

419
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:14,975
And once again,
it becomes my job to fix it.

420
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:18,729
Hey, hey, everybody!
Something happened!

421
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:20,898
Those guys
from Vance Refrigeration,

422
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,692
they let the air out
of our tires! What?

423
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:26,487
Yeah, they punk'd us, they
punk'd us good! Come on! Come on!

424
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,575
Does Bob Vance
work for Vance Refrigeration?

425
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,118
Does he ever.

426
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,878
Man, they got us so bad. We
cannot let them get away with this!

427
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:47,467
We have got to pull together as
one and steal their refrigerators!

428
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,093
Yeah!
Yeah?

429
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,511
I don't think we can do that.

430
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,929
Go home, Toby. Just...

431
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,765
Hey. Why doesn't your car
have a flat tire?

432
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:59,349
Why? I will tell you why. Because
they saved the worst for me!

433
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,523
They put a hate note
under my windshield wiper.

434
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,442
Check this out,
it's so hateful.

435
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,151
"You guys suck!

436
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:08,946
"You can never pull together
as one and revenge us!

437
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,656
"That is why you suck!"

438
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,616
For crying out loud.

439
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,619
No. No, no, no, no!
No, you are falling for it!

440
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:18,789
You are playing right into their hands.
This is just what they want you to do!

441
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,124
Don't, okay.
What is with this guy?

442
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,210
Got an hour?
I'll try to explain.

443
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:27,715
This is egregious!

444
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:31,510
This is egregious!

445
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,888
Trust me, it only gets worse.

446
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:38,684
Is he always like this? Sometimes
he brings more costumes.

447
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,269
When do people work?

448
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,064
We find little times
during the day.

449
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,815
How are we gonna get home?

450
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:48,485
Bob Vance has an air pump.
He said he'd fill all our tires up.

451
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,946
Bob Vance
of Vance Refrigeration.

452
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,201
See that?
Mission accomplished.

453
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,411
They're like
a bunch of fourth graders.

454
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,874
Sometimes what brings the kids
together is hating the lunch lady.

455
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,293
Although, that'll change!

456
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,922
Because by the end of the
fourth grade, the lunch lady

457
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,175
was actually the person
I hung out with the most.

458
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,641
- Jell-O. Hi, Jan.
- Michael!

459
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,476
Did you fire Tony Gardner
when he was trying to quit?

460
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,060
I did. Major personnel crisis
averted. Compliment accepted.

461
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:29,401
Do you realize, Michael, that we
now have to pay him severance?

462
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:30,819
Yes.

463
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,780
You do?

464
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,200
But do you realize that that
was actually Dwight's idea?

465
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,827
Bad advice
from my number two.

466
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,496
What? No, no, no,
Jim is your number two.

467
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,748
What?

468
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,792
He is the only one who
has worked with both groups.

469
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,128
I sent you a memo about this.

470
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:51,465
Yes, I know that,
for I do read the memos.

471
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:56,721
So, after a great deal of
thought and introspectivtion,

472
00:25:56,804 --> 00:26:00,349
I have decided to make
Jim my new number two.

473
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,812
If he even wants it. It
doesn't come with a pay raise.

474
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,814
No, it does, actually.

475
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,942
So who will be
your new number three?

476
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,944
That I have not decided yet.

477
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,447
Michael, I would just like
to say that you have handled

478
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,866
this entire situation
with great aplomb.

479
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,827
Thank you, Andy,
that's very kind, thanks.

480
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,247
And I have to say that your
leadership has brought...

481
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,791
Shut it. Shut it. That's...

482
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,253
Suck-up.

483
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,094
Hey, where you at, Filippelli?

484
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:41,515
I'm at the grocery store buying
a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.

485
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,435
What's wrong, you didn't
have a good first day?

486
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,895
Oh, my God!

487
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:49,314
Hey, you wanna meet at
Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.

488
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,942
Yeah, sure. Sounds good. I...

489
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,987
Hey, you know what? Can
I give you a call right back?

490
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,114
Yeah. Bye.
Okay, thanks.

491
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,492
Hey!

492
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:02,661
I thought
you had already left.

493
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:06,916
No, I just had some
other stuff I had to do.

494
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,042
Good.
What's up?

495
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,419
Oh, nothing, I just feel bad.

496
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,796
I feel like things were a little
weird today, or something.

497
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,506
What do you mean?

498
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,633
I just think I should tell you that
I've sort of started seeing someone.

499
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,221
And...

500
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:24,558
That's totally cool.
You can do whatever you want.

501
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,646
Okay, good.

502
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:31,398
We're friends.
We'll always be friends.

503
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,776
Right.

504
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,695
It's good to have you back.

505
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,281
Yeah, good to be back.

506
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,088
Saw your dork-mobile
in the parking lot.

507
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,548
What does it get, like,
four miles to the gallon?

508
00:27:55,631 --> 00:27:57,215
Try double that.

509
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,177
Classic Trans Am, vintage
American muscle. Please.

510
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,931
Yeah, my Xterra is pretty
sweet. Luxurious yet rugged.

511
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,016
Leave it to the Japanese.

512
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,767
Xterra's not even a real word.

513
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,520
Actually, it is,
it's Latin for "earth."

514
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,607
Oh, so you drive an X-earth?
Yeah, that makes sense.

515
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:16,401
I'd rather drive a classic
Trans Am than an X-earth.

516
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,696
Yeah, I bet you would.

517
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,823
Oh, by the way, 1985 called.
It wants its car back.

518
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:25,119
Well, I hope 1985 has a time
machine, 'cause I drive an '87.

519
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,454
Speaking of time machines?

520
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:29,498
I just got back from the future, and I
went to your funeral, and guess what?

521
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,958
Nobody came.

522
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:35,542
Speaking of funerals, why
don't you go ahead and go die?

523
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,967
That was a really
well-constructed sentence.

524
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:44,513
You should be an English
professor at Cor-Not University.

525
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,265
Idiot!

526
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,809
If I were an idiot,
I'd be driving a Trans Am.

527
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,436
If you were driving
a Trans Am,

528
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,605
you'd be the smartest idiot
in the whole world.

529
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,857
Idiot!

530
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,694
You're the idiot.

531
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,571
Nice comeback.

532
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:04,950
I was making fun of
your comeback. That's why it worked.

533
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:11,039
I totally got the best
of that interchange.
