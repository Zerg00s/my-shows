1
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:08,466
David...
Oh, Michael...

2
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:10,217
Are we all set?

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:14,388
Isn't our interview tomorrow?

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,601
Yes. I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,268
Thought I'd drop in
and say hello.

6
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,147
Just happened to be
in midtown Manhattan?

7
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,731
Thought I'd catch a show.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,735
In the middle of a workday?
No.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,363
You know what, since I'm here,

10
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:34,491
let me ask you a few questions
about the job.

11
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,953
Okay. How many people
are you interviewing?

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,789
We're only interviewing
branch managers

13
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,540
and some lower-level
company people.

14
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,334
Ah, well, good.

15
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,585
Out of curiosity,
are you interviewing anyone

16
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,254
who has been here
longer than I have

17
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,214
or manages more people?

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,676
I don't think so.
Great. One more question.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,888
When you merged those
branches, who did you put in charge?

20
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,641
I believe
we put you in charge.

21
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,559
Ah, great.
No further questions.

22
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,852
Okay, Michael.
Okay.

23
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,688
I'm really looking forward
to our interview.

24
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,981
And I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

25
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:14,740
I have got it made in the
shade. I know this company.

26
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,326
The other branch managers are
total morons.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,537
Hey, Pam, yeah, I forgot
what day the interview was.

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,038
I drove
to New York accidentally.

29
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,706
Be, like, three hours late.

30
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:49,312
See, I have 600...
Yeah, I don't have... Hey.

31
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:50,985
Hey, Kev.

32
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,654
What's different about you?

33
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,823
You look worse.
Thank you.

34
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:58,617
You got a haircut.
It's sexy hot.

35
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,703
Turn around.
Oh.

36
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,120
Come on.
No.

37
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:03,788
No, thanks.
Do it!

38
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,127
Look at that do!
What's up, Big Haircut?

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,753
You are no longer Big Tuna.

40
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,171
From henceforth,
you shall be known

41
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:12,256
as Big Haircut.

42
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,299
Andy.
What is it, Big Haircut?

43
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:16,009
No. Sorry, I can't
hear you, Big Haircut.

44
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,135
Yep.
What?

45
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:21,719
Karen suggested that I get a
haircut for the interview tomorrow,

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,311
so that I could look
presentable and not,

47
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:28,647
as she so lovingly
puts it, homeless.

48
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,485
Hey. I think it looks great.
Thanks, Pam.

49
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,033
After I had my little outburst
at the beach,

50
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:42,202
Jim was really nice about it.

51
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:43,495
He just basically said

52
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,622
that he missed
my friendship, too,

53
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:47,541
and I would always
mean a lot to him.

54
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,501
And I understand
where he's coming from.

55
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:52,254
For the record,
I am not embarrassed at all.

56
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:55,215
It needed to be said
and I said it

57
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,384
and it only took me
three years

58
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,510
to summon the courage.

59
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,762
So, thank you.

60
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,432
Yeah?

61
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,684
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,937
The time has come
to name my own replacement.

63
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,563
So...

64
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,190
Please hand this letter
of congratulations

65
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,527
to Dwight K. Schrute.

66
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,322
But that's my name.

67
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,248
"Dwight,
congratulations, a-wipe."

68
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,583
"Don't screw the pooch."

69
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,383
Thank you.
Okay.

70
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,847
All right.
Thank you, Michael.

71
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:44,932
Okay.

72
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,815
Thank you so much.
Hey, stop crying.

73
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,566
Thank you.

74
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,619
Hey.

75
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,831
About the beach...
It's okay.

76
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:11,583
We all say things
without thinking.

77
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,210
Oh, no. It's not that.

78
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,629
I've actually been thinking
that for a long time

79
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,131
and I'm glad I said it.

80
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,883
I just am sorry
if it made you feel weird.

81
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:24,679
Oh. Okay.

82
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,975
Pam is kind of a bitch.

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,229
Hey, what if we leave tonight?

84
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,442
Grab a bite, get a hotel room,
enjoy the city a little bit?

85
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,488
I just have
so much paperwork to do.

86
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,411
Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.

87
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,290
So I was wondering if Karen
and I could get off a few hours early

88
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:53,083
because we wanted to
spend the night in the city.

89
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,878
Why, so you can do it?
Whoops.

90
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,047
No, well,
I was thinking that, actually,

91
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:02,675
we can all leave tomorrow
and do a convoy, you know?

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,596
Convoys are really fun.

93
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,848
Pull up next to each other,
give each other the finger.

94
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:10,892
Moon each other.

95
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,353
We're going to go tonight,

96
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,104
but we're going to see you
there tomorrow morning, right?

97
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,522
All right.
All right. Your loss.

98
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,525
Wait, how would you moon us
if you were driving?

99
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,360
Cruise control.

100
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:25,157
So, Jim, who do you think
is hotter, Pam or Karen?

101
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,869
Yeah, I'm not going to talk
about this now. Pam is taller.

102
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,247
You sure?
Yes.

103
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,791
She has bigger breasts, too.
Wow.

104
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,127
But I think Karen
has a prettier face.

105
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,424
What else?

106
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,512
Well, I mean, Pam's face
is really pretty, too.

107
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:47,804
It's a very tough call.

108
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,892
Really tough call.
Yeah.

109
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,852
You know what, why don't
you take the rest of the day

110
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:55,520
and figure it out

111
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:57,564
and then come back
and tell me what you've got.

112
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,359
Will do.
All right.

113
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,654
Yes.

114
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,740
Hey, Pam,

115
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:10,327
I've been meaning to say something
to you. I really miss our friendship.

116
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,498
That's very funny. I've never
heard you talk that much.

117
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,083
I thought it was Kelly.

118
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,960
Are you kidding?
I would never have done that.

119
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,171
It was Patheticville.
no offense, Pam.

120
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,382
You know what,
don't even worry about it.

121
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:26,426
Everyone was so drunk, I bet no
one even remembers what you said.

122
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,637
I remember.
I blogged the whole thing.

123
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:33,221
www.creedthoughts.gov.
www/creedthoughts.

124
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:36,477
Check it out.

125
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,690
Last year, Creed asked me
how to set up a blog.

126
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:45,108
Wanting to protect the world from
being exposed to Creed's brain,

127
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,323
I opened up a Word document
on his computer

128
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,367
and put an address at the top.

129
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,869
I've read some of it.

130
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:56,581
Even for the Internet,
it's pretty shocking.

131
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,043
There they are,
the accounting department.

132
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:03,547
I shall miss your humility and
your promptly printed checks.

133
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,132
Do you think
it's going to be weird

134
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,217
working with Jan in New York?

135
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,387
No. Not at all. I haven't talked
to Jan since we broke up.

136
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,308
And I think if she had something
to say, she would have called me.

137
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,601
Maybe you should talk to
her before... No, no, no, no.

138
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,895
You know what,
it's a done deal.

139
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,772
I basically
have the job already.

140
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:23,984
There's nothing she can do to
stop it now. I already sold my condo.

141
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,402
- Michael.
- What?

142
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,654
Why? I'm sorry
that just doesn't make sense.

143
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,323
Yes. Why... Who
gave you that advice?

144
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:31,533
Yeah, Michael,
you should never...

145
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,744
...sell your condo.
I have to buy another place.

146
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:34,869
But you said
you were in debt.

147
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,497
I'm not. You're not sure
that you have the job.

148
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,080
I sold it on eBay. The buyer
was very motivated as was I.

149
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:43,962
It went for 80%
of what I paid.

150
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,881
Sold in record time.

151
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:47,966
How would you like
to spend the night

152
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,219
with the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton?

153
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,554
No, Dwight,

154
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,722
I don't care if that's

155
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,807
how they consolidated power

156
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:55,891
in ancient Rome, I'm...

157
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,476
No, no. Not Michael.

158
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,895
Me. I'm taking his job.

159
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,524
Not now.

160
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,199
Goodbye, Kelly Kapour.

161
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,747
Jim, Jim, Jim.

162
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:23,626
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

163
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,630
Oh, hey, Dwight.

164
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,175
I am going to be
your new boss.

165
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,678
It is my greatest dream
come true.

166
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,345
Welcome to the Hotel Hell.

167
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,599
Check-in time is now.
Checkout time is never.

168
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,185
Does my room have cable?

169
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,772
And the sheets are made
of fire. Can I change rooms?

170
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,568
Sorry, we're all booked up.
Hell convention in town.

171
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,946
Can I have a late checkout?
I'll have to talk to the manager.

172
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,199
You're not the manager?
Even in your own fantasy?

173
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,869
I'm the owner.

174
00:08:57,077 --> 00:09:01,039
The co-owner. With Satan.
Okay.

175
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,584
Just so I understand it,
in your wildest fantasy,

176
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:05,919
you are in Hell

177
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,673
and you are co-running
a bed and breakfast

178
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:10,758
with the Devil.

179
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,386
Yeah, but I haven't told
you my salary yet. Go.

180
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,848
$80,000 a year.

181
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,515
Once I am officially
regional manager,

182
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,186
my first order of business
will be to demote Jim Halpert.

183
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,438
So I will need
a new number two.

184
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,440
My ideal choice?

185
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,526
Jack Bauer.

186
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:34,735
But he is unavailable,
fictional, and overqualified.

187
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,327
I will see you

188
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,455
at the interview.

189
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,792
Yes, you will.

190
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,794
Who is D. Abramson?

191
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,422
He's from that company
in Pittsburgh. Michael.

192
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,092
Why are you here?

193
00:09:57,721 --> 00:10:00,515
How are you?
I'm good. How are you, Janet?

194
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,058
I'm... I'm great.
It's good to see you.

195
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:12,193
Can we... Can we talk
privately for a minute?

196
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,279
Why privately?

197
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,449
I just... I don't...

198
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,369
I don't like the way
that we left things.

199
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,247
Okay, sure. Fine. Why
don't you wait in my office?

200
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:27,834
I have some important
business matters to take care of.

201
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,046
Okay.
Okay.

202
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,466
Pam, DEFCON 10.
Houston, we have a problem.

203
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:39,596
What do you want me to do?

204
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,100
I may need some
immediate assistance.

205
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:47,562
If you would slowly and quietly gather
the ladies in the conference room,

206
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,022
Phyllis, Angela, Karen.

207
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,483
What about Meredith?

208
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:52,900
She's an alternate.

209
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,946
So, how you been?
I'm good.

210
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,030
Good. Good.
Good.

211
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,907
Yeah.

212
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,451
Sorry to drop by
unexpectedly. I...

213
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,955
I tried calling, but I kept
getting voicemail. Weird.

214
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,206
Yeah. I didn't get
both of your messages.

215
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,047
So, Michael needs us
in the conference room.

216
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,966
Oh, is it Jan again?

217
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,925
Hey, before I leave tonight,

218
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,221
would you mind making half a dozen
copies of Jim's and my sales reports

219
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,306
for our interviews tomorrow?

220
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,265
Sure.
Thanks.

221
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,103
I really hope you get the job.
Thanks.

222
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:35,731
After you ended everything
with us, I went on a vacation

223
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,739
to kind of clear my mind.
Sounds good. Sounds fun.

224
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,867
It was. Yeah, it was good.

225
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,536
I think I should just...

226
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:46,829
Get right to the
point, you know. Okay.

227
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:50,708
I... I feel good
about myself

228
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:53,002
for the first time
in a really long time,

229
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:57,173
and I've made some
big changes in my life,

230
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,635
and I miss you.

231
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,891
I want us
to get back together.

232
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:13,523
Would you excuse
me for a second? Oh.

233
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,776
DEFCON 20.

234
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,405
She wants to get back together.
What are you going to do?

235
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,033
I don't know. hat's why
you're here. Help me. Please.

236
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,283
Would you want to
get back together with her?

237
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,994
No. No.

238
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,122
What do I do? Just don't
get back together with her.

239
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,248
What if she makes me?

240
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,916
How can she make you
get back together with her?

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,044
She made me do a lot of things
I didn't want to do.

242
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:37,046
This was
a terrible relationship.

243
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,631
You were not happy
when you were with her.

244
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:41,509
I wasn't.
You're so much happier now.

245
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:44,470
Just go in there and
be strong. You're right.

246
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,556
You are absolutely right.

247
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,100
I need to go in there and tell
her that we can't be together.

248
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,185
Right.

249
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,144
Wow.
Do it.

250
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,231
I'm in a very good
place right now. 
Okay.

251
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:55,315
- Thank you.
- Go.

252
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,946
Okay. Jan,

253
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,116
we need to talk.

254
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,875
Jan is in
a different place right now.

255
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,213
And it is a sign of maturity
to give people second chances.

256
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:21,215
So I'm going to hear her out.

257
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:27,805
Oh, my God.

258
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:37,273
Yeah. Bigger actually.
That's crazy.

259
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,655
Oh, my God. Can you
believe that? Unbelievable.

260
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,992
Wow! She could put
the cup right there.

261
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,076
I know.

262
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,661
No, it's fine.

263
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,663
I'm sure it must have been
weird for Jim

264
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,749
when Roy and I
were joking around

265
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,917
that one time.

266
00:13:58,545 --> 00:13:59,796
I would
never do that.

267
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,423
Waste of money.

268
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,425
In my experience,

269
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,677
guys are way more attracted to
the back of you than to the front.

270
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:08,680
I love fake boobs.

271
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,766
Oftentimes you find them
on strippers.

272
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,061
I find it offensive.
Au naturel, baby.

273
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,356
That's how I like them.
Swing low, sweet chariots.

274
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,443
So, there are a lot of things
I would like to do differently.

275
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,154
Yeah. I feel like when
we first got together,

276
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:27,114
that I had a problem
with my priorities.

277
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,200
First stop, priorities.

278
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:32,662
And if we could talk about a way to
approach a possible reconciliation.

279
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
Let's get back together.

280
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,252
No. No, no, no.
I'll tell you this,

281
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,212
it is not because
of the boob job.

282
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,423
Excuse me, boob enhancement.

283
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,760
That would be shallow. And
this is the opposite of shallow.

284
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,178
This is
emotionally magnificent.

285
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,514
Okay, everyone, listen up!

286
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,850
Time to begin
the interview process.

287
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:57,687
Andrew Bernard.

288
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,398
Save the best for first.

289
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,859
All right, you guys,
see you later. Wish us luck.

290
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,028
No. Hey, hey,
do not wish them luck.

291
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,115
Do not wish them luck. All luck
must be wished unto Michael.

292
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,199
Good luck, you guys.

293
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:10,992
Good luck.
What did I say?

294
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,910
Good luck.
Thanks.

295
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,126
I'm happy for him.
I hope he gets the job.

296
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,545
I really just want him
to be happy.

297
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,047
And I know that sounds cliche,

298
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,300
and I know saying it
sounds cliche sounds cliche.

299
00:15:29,052 --> 00:15:32,972
Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't
care because I am what I am.

300
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:36,726
That's Popeye.

301
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:38,978
I am going to
begin this process

302
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:42,607
with a simple test of
intelligence and mental dexterity.

303
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,235
What is the best color?
White.

304
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,779
Because it contains
all other colors.

305
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,907
Wrong. Black.
It is the most dominant.

306
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:52,492
How do you make a table?

307
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,662
You make a chair,
but you don't sit on it.

308
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:56,912
What is the capital of Maine?

309
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,624
The capital of Maine
is Montpelier, Vermont,

310
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,545
which is near Ithaca, New York
where I went to Cornell.

311
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,255
Okay, also,
moratorium on Cornell talk.

312
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:07,465
Don't want to hear about it.

313
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,093
Forget your personal history and
learn the history of this company.

314
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,178
Should not be a problem.

315
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,262
I minored in history

316
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,929
in the Ivy League school
which I attended.

317
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,851
You're not off to a very
good start, Bernard. I agree.

318
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:19,978
But in another way,

319
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,481
I am off to a very good start,
wouldn't you say?

320
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:27,818
I am a great interviewee. Why?

321
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,115
Because I have something
no one else has, my brain,

322
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,118
which I use to my advantage
when advantageous.

323
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,541
Time! No, you failed.
Damn it!

324
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,502
This interview is over.
I'll let you know.

325
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:50,341
Hey, thank you so much for
driving me down for my interview.

326
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,009
Totally. No problem.

327
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,095
What are you interviewing for,
by the way?

328
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,680
My assistant? Or...

329
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,975
Oh, you know, I'm going to
have a congratulations Karen party

330
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:03,104
tomorrow night at a friend's
house. Oh, wow. That sounds fun.

331
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:06,565
Is your friend named Karen,
too? What did she accomplish?

332
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,903
No. I'm sorry, I should
have been clearer. It's for me.

333
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,654
Because I'm going
to get the job. Oh.

334
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:17,618
How remarkable.
Thanks.

335
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:21,164
Wait, wait a second.

336
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,249
Let me check one more thing.
Okay.

337
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,711
Very good.

338
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,886
All right, well,
I have to get back.

339
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,721
But I will see you
in New York tomorrow, right?

340
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,806
Yes, indeed.

341
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,976
Good luck with your interview.
Thank you.

342
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,103
Bye.

343
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:53,321
So I guess we're getting
back together. What happened?

344
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,866
Your advice was good,
but Jan's was bigger.

345
00:17:57,784 --> 00:17:59,160
Here's the sitch.

346
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,581
Two weeks ago, I was in the
worst relationship of my life.

347
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,877
She treated me poorly, we
didn't connect, I was miserable.

348
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:13,045
Now, I'm in the best relationship
of my life with the same woman.

349
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:17,553
Love is a mystery.

350
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,391
So, we have all night.
Where do you want to go first?

351
00:18:21,474 --> 00:18:23,809
I don't know.
How about the UN?

352
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,396
How often do you come here?

353
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,982
Every time my sixth grade
class was on a field trip.

354
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,110
I think you're really going to
enjoy this, adult Jim.

355
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,242
Hey, everybody,

356
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,788
the next time you see me I
will be working for corporate.

357
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:48,375
Starting tomorrow, Dwight
Schrute will be running the branch.

358
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,046
So without further ado,

359
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:57,134
I would like to start
saying my goodbyes.

360
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:01,013
For everything
you've done

361
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,809
You know I'm bound

362
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,519
Okay.

363
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,605
I'm bound
to thank you for it...

364
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:12,483
Good night

365
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,069
and good luck.

366
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,541
Who's ready to work?

367
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,713
Yeah. We went
to the Spotted Pig for dinner.

368
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,217
It's in the Village.
Karen knew it.

369
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,677
And then we
second acted Spamalot.

370
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,555
That's when you sneak in at
intermission with all the smokers.

371
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,184
And then we went to a bar
that used to be a church.

372
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,354
Oh, and at this one bar,
I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.

373
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,938
That wasn't him.

374
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,610
So what's going to happen
with us when I get this job?

375
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,361
Oh, you mean,
when I get the job?

376
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:02,449
Well, if you get the job,
then I'd move here with you.

377
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,872
Would you move with me?
I'm not stupid, okay?

378
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,207
I was at the beach.

379
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,043
We don't have a future
in Scranton.

380
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,962
There's one too many
people there.

381
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:19,508
You mean, Kevin?
Exactly.

382
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,929
No, but you get it, right?

383
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,473
I can't stay there.

384
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,935
Yeah. I do.

385
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,271
Come on.

386
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,411
How are you guys doing?
Need anything?

387
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:49,705
No. We're good. Thanks.

388
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,917
I have been here a bunch of
times, so I know where everything is.

389
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,168
Know everybody's names.

390
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:56,504
If you need to know
somebody's name, just ask me.

391
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,802
Well, who's that?
That is Beardy.

392
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,345
Beardy?

393
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,390
I'm going to introduce myself.
No, no. That's not his real name.

394
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,892
That's just
what I call him. So...

395
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,645
I am by far the most qualified
person they're interviewing.

396
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,773
Jim and Karen are here,
which is cute.

397
00:21:16,107 --> 00:21:20,607
They're like kid actors tagging
along with Daddy on the big audition,

398
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:25,612
hoping to be discovered, except
Daddy is the best actor around.

399
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,661
Daddy is Meryl Streep.

400
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,163
Michael is gone.

401
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,875
Hail to the chief.

402
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,295
My first order of business,

403
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,048
make Andrew Bernard
my number two.

404
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:44,093
My first order
of business, accept.

405
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,888
As if you have a choice. Duh.

406
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,515
Opportunity of a lifetime.

407
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,978
Three months ago,
I was nowhere.

408
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,856
I was just a Cornell grad
in anger management.

409
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,317
Look where I am now.

410
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:01,568
Not bad.

411
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,743
Hey, Hunter.
What's up, my brother?

412
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,955
This is Hunter,
secretary extraordinaire.

413
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,624
Administrative assistant.
Jan in yet?

414
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:15,791
I think she's coming in later.

415
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,877
Could you give her a message
for me when she gets in?

416
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,795
Sure.

417
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:23,299
Just say I want to
squeeze them.

418
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,929
It's code. She'll know
what it means. Okay.

419
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,057
Oh, Hunter,
could you tell her...also?

420
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,439
You showed great leadership
potential at the coal walk,

421
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:42,151
even if you did follow it with that
embarrassing personal confession.

422
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:43,778
Thank you.

423
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,490
I had to make Andy my number
two. It's political, complicated.

424
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,783
You wouldn't understand.

425
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:53,367
I want you to be
assistant regional manager.

426
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:57,083
Really?
Well, in a sense.

427
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,167
Although, publicly,

428
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,170
I am going to retain the assistant
regional manager position.

429
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:02,713
You will be
your own assistant.

430
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:04,548
Correct. I need
someone I can trust.

431
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:09,383
But I would also like the title
to be secretly applied to you.

432
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,809
Just stripped off its
pomp and frills. Okay.

433
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,438
So you would be
the regional manager

434
00:23:20,106 --> 00:23:22,274
and the assistant
regional manager,

435
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:25,110
Andy is your number two.

436
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,239
I would be the secret
assistant regional manager.

437
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,200
Let's call it secret assistant
to the regional manager.

438
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:36,455
Do you accept?
Absolutely I do.

439
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:37,915
I learned from Jim,

440
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,127
if Dwight ever asks you if
you accept something secret,

441
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,880
you reply, "Absolutely I do."

442
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:51,887
Hello, hello!
Michael, good to see you.

443
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:52,972
Good to see you.
Have a seat.

444
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,725
Here are the post-merger
performance tests that you asked for.

445
00:23:55,808 --> 00:23:56,975
Great.

446
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,727
I've been meaning
to thank you, by the way.

447
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:00,729
You didn't lose a single
customer in the merger

448
00:24:00,813 --> 00:24:03,524
and you still managed to trim
the budget. That is nice work.

449
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,155
So, let me ask you a question
right off the bat,

450
00:24:09,238 --> 00:24:11,740
what do you think are your
greatest strengths as a manager?

451
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:14,451
Why don't I tell you what
my greatest weaknesses are?

452
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,830
I work too hard,
I care too much,

453
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,584
and sometimes I can be
too invested in my job.

454
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,504
Okay. And your strengths?

455
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,425
Well, my weaknesses
are actually strengths.

456
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,845
Oh. Yes. Very good.

457
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,805
There you go.
Very good.

458
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,184
Dwight is our new boss. No,
Michael's not going anywhere.

459
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,437
Then who do you think
will get the job? Karen.

460
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,775
She looks corporate.
Those little pantsuits.

461
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,443
I think
it's going to be Michael.

462
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,528
Do you really think
he's qualified for that job?

463
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:53,157
No, but he wasn't qualified for the
job he has now and he got that one.

464
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:54,450
Yeah.

465
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,078
Listen up. Come to the
center of the room, please.

466
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,915
This is a Schrute Buck.

467
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,877
When you have done
something good,

468
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,880
you will receive
one Schrute Buck.

469
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:12,760
One thousand Schrute Bucks
equals an extra five minutes for lunch.

470
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,846
What is the cash value
of a Schrute Buck?

471
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,183
Excellent question, Pam.
One one-hundredth of a cent.

472
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,268
So, 10,000

473
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,520
of your dollars is worth
one real dollar? Just...

474
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:24,855
Zip your lid.

475
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,524
Another announcement.

476
00:25:26,607 --> 00:25:28,609
Michael wasted
an enormous amount

477
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,777
of the group's time
and patience

478
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,321
with non-work-related
ethnic celebrations

479
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,241
and parades of soft-minded
do-goodedness.

480
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,034
No longer.

481
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,162
No more meetings.
Amen.

482
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:44,746
Instead, today, I will begin my first
lecture in a long series of lectures

483
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,211
designed to increase your
knowledge on the world of paper.

484
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,089
Do we have to?
Yes. Michael is gone.

485
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:54,343
There's a new sheriff here in
these offices and his name is me.

486
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:58,055
Conference room,
10 seconds. All of you!

487
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,016
I literally cannot wait until I
see what Dwight has planned.

488
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,853
And I wish Jim were here.

489
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,315
What do you think
we can be doing better?

490
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,318
I've never been a big fan
of the name Dunder Mifflin.

491
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,779
I was thinking we could name
the company something like

492
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,199
Paper Great
or Great Paper's Our Passion.

493
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,077
We're great.

494
00:26:20,286 --> 00:26:22,121
I don't know.
It could be good.

495
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,708
Or Super Duper Paper.
It's super duper.

496
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,169
I don't know.
Something like that.

497
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,213
Okay.
Okay.

498
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,964
Thanks for coming in, Michael.
Thank you.

499
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,008
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

500
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,886
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

501
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,598
So, oh, before I forget,
I wanted to let you know,

502
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:44,226
if you hadn't already heard,
Jan and I are back together.

503
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,770
So I may need to fill out

504
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,980
one of those
love documents again.

505
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,690
You're back together.
Yes.

506
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,485
And I am very excited about
the prospect of working under her.

507
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:54,027
Or on top of her.

508
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,697
That's not sexual. Just...
We're all professionals.

509
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,782
Okay.

510
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:02,328
Well, I thought it was clear in
the description of the position.

511
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,915
The job you're applying
for is Jan's job.

512
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,750
I don't understand.
So we're going to tag-team it?

513
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,295
No. We're letting Jan go.

514
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:14,715
Listen up.

515
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,718
Let's start
from the ground up.

516
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,096
Where does paper come from?

517
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,598
- Trees.
- Trees.

518
00:27:23,057 --> 00:27:24,475
And where do trees grow?

519
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:28,270
Forests.
Soil.

520
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:29,355
Right.

521
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,607
We have in front of you here

522
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:35,110
seven different types
of Pennsylvania topsoil.

523
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,282
Now, what would you say is

524
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,325
the most important element

525
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:44,412
in the production
of aboveground leafy growth?

526
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,417
Probably phosphorus,
right? Wrong.

527
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,294
It's nitrogen.
Absorb this information.

528
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,467
Good. Now,
let us discuss precipitation.

529
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,970
Stanley, when rainfall occurs,

530
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,429
does it usually fall

531
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:05,849
in a liquid, solid,
or gaseous state?

532
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,061
Liquid.
Very good.

533
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,731
You have earned one
Schrute Buck. I don't want it.

534
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,068
Then you have been deducted
50 Schrute Bucks.

535
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,070
Make it 100.
Well...

536
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,656
Don't you want to earn
Schrute Bucks? No.

537
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:26,241
In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley
Nickels if you never talk to me again.

538
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:29,081
What's the ratio of Stanley
Nickels to Schrute Bucks?

539
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,375
The same as the ratio
of unicorns to leprechauns.

540
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,295
Okay. That's it! Class is
canceled. Everybody out!

541
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,004
No, wait, what are you doing?
I'm punishing them.

542
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:37,422
No, no, no, no.
Class is not canceled.

543
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:38,548
This is so stupid.

544
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,426
Hey! Come on!

545
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,553
Let's listen
to Dwight's presentation.

546
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,975
What... What are you
winking for? Zip your lid!

547
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:52,521
So that's my basic five-year plan
and then after that who knows?

548
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,648
Okay.

549
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,735
Now, this may seem like
an odd question. Yeah?

550
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,779
What do you think
about Michael Scott?

551
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,782
He's a very nice man.

552
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,451
And he's very well-suited
for the job he has now.

553
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,079
This is off the record.
He would be a disaster.

554
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,172
Hey, you.

555
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,882
How was your interview?
Pretty good.

556
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,593
Yeah? Could have
gone better, I guess.

557
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:27,177
Oh. Well, I will put in a
good word for you. Cool.

558
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,100
Maybe you should do it sooner
rather than later.

559
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:31,310
What?
Let's just run away together.

560
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,646
Let's just run away to
Jamaica, live in a bungalow.

561
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:37,399
You have some savings, right? You
can pay off my debts. It would be fine.

562
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:41,153
We'd have fun. What's...
What's the matter? What...

563
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,446
What happened in there?

564
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,115
I can't tell you.

565
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:48,410
Tell me what?

566
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,419
You son of a bitch.

567
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,505
Jan, this isn't the time. I'm in
an interview... You're firing me?

568
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,631
Where the hell do you get off?

569
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,676
Frankly, it's overdue.

570
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,180
Your behavior in the last two
years has been completely erratic.

571
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,265
Erratic?

572
00:30:09,348 --> 00:30:11,516
Recently you don't even show
an interest in your work.

573
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,393
You smoke constantly
in your office,

574
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,520
you spend most of the day
online shopping.

575
00:30:15,604 --> 00:30:18,023
You disappear for hours
at a time, sometimes days,

576
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,526
always saying you're visiting
your sister in Scottsdale.

577
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,319
You go to Scranton
far more often than you...

578
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,404
Is it because of these?

579
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,364
Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan. Come on. Is
it... No, I want to know! I want to know!

580
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,743
Because if it is, then...
Then I will see you in court.

581
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,203
It's not. It's not.

582
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,997
Because he likes them, okay?

583
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,958
He likes them. And that is...
That is all I care about.

584
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,502
The time has come for you to
end your professional relationship

585
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,712
with this company.

586
00:30:39,795 --> 00:30:42,798
You are clearly unstable.
Hey, you're unstable.

587
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,466
Yeah.

588
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:47,469
- We're all unstable.
- Okay, do you know what?

589
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:51,265
I'm just not leaving. I'm
not leaving. I'm not leaving.

590
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,684
David, I did not tell her.

591
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,441
It's like I'm staring into my
soul when I look at this wall.

592
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:03,652
It's like outer spac
without the stars.

593
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,322
It's so black. This is
going to look SO awesome.

594
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:08,448
It's so intimidating.

595
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,660
Anyone who come in here is
going to have to take me seriously.

596
00:31:11,994 --> 00:31:14,496
Abandon all hope ye
who enter here.

597
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,123
Totally!

598
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:30,136
Bye, Hunter.
Bye.

599
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,348
Good luck with your band.

600
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,976
Oh, thank you... Don't let
them change you, okay?

601
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,708
So long...

602
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,046
So I am going to
give her a ride home.

603
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:06,506
Let me know about the job.

604
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,133
Actually, Michael,
I think we're going

605
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,426
to take it
in another direction.

606
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,053
Good. I'm glad we're
on the same page.

607
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,638
I have a lot of ideas
for new directions.

608
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:15,682
No, we're not
giving you the job.

609
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,483
You know what?
That is actually good

610
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:29,067
because I don't think I
could take my girlfriend's job.

611
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,991
That's not being
a good boyfriend.

612
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:37,575
So I respectfully withdraw
my name from consideration.

613
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:41,541
Do you accept my withdrawal?
I do.

614
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:45,503
Good. Very good. I'm glad
we are finally on the same page.

615
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,213
Still have my job
in Scranton, though?

616
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,465
Yes.
Good.

617
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,717
That's all I ever wanted.

618
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:55,301
These two, either one of them,
excellent candidates.

619
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:01,478
Wow.

620
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:06,358
That was some serious,
hardcore self-destruction.

621
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,485
Yeah.

622
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:09,277
I kind of feel bad
for her, though.

623
00:33:09,361 --> 00:33:11,237
Don't. She's nuts.

624
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:14,741
Oh, man.

625
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:18,661
You know what,
this might take a while.

626
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,831
You really don't have to stay
if you don't want.

627
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,501
Okay, good because a bunch of my
friends are meeting downtown for lunch

628
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,212
and I was going to
meet them. So... All right.

629
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,381
Just call me when you're done.
Sure.

630
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,343
Good luck, Halpert.
Thank you.

631
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,059
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Grace. Sure.

632
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,689
Oh, God.

633
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,357
I mean
I just don't understand.

634
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,192
It's just so rude, you know.
I know. I know.

635
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:50,944
I mean, the absolute
nerve of that guy.

636
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,321
I am sorry about that.
That was terrible. Oh, just...

637
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:54,948
No, actually,
I think it's good.

638
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:57,159
You know, it's fine,
actually. I do.

639
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,411
I really think it's great
that it happened because,

640
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,288
you know, my work
has always been the thing

641
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,290
that's gotten in the way
of my happiness. So...

642
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,541
Yeah.

643
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,629
Well, it's...

644
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,678
No, don't cry.

645
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:20,223
It's going to be okay. Oh, I
know. I know. It's just... I'm sorry.

646
00:34:20,307 --> 00:34:24,102
It's just these painkillers that I
started taking since the surgery.

647
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,853
Oh, they make my moods
totally unpredictable. Wow.

648
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,902
What am I going to do?
I don't know.

649
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,909
Well, I guess you could come
and stay at my condo.

650
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,538
I think I could back
out of the sale.

651
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:43,747
I would probably get
some negative feedback

652
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,040
on my eBay profile, but...

653
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,460
Live together. Actually, wait
a minute, this could be great.

654
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,545
This could be perfect.

655
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:51,504
You know, my full-time
job can be our relationship.

656
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,216
I can wear stretch pants and
wait for you to come home at 5:15.

657
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,343
It could work.
This could work, really.

658
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,106
I'll be back.

659
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,401
And I am back.

660
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,445
How did it go?
No, no, Pam.

661
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,823
I'm back

662
00:35:17,906 --> 00:35:20,241
for good.

663
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:21,993
Kevin Nealon.

664
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:24,662
Everybody, may I have
your attention please?

665
00:35:25,122 --> 00:35:28,583
It is with great honor
and privilege

666
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,293
that I announce to you,

667
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:32,170
I have officially
withdrawn my name

668
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:34,297
for consideration
from the corporate job.

669
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:38,093
I know, I know, I know.
Michael, what are you thinking?

670
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,011
You were a shoo-in. Well...

671
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,347
I got down there,
I nailed the interview

672
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,058
and the strangest
thing happened.

673
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:47,477
Why is my office black?

674
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:51,856
To intimidate my subordinates.
That's stupid.

675
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:55,193
It was Andy's idea.
You shouldn't have taken it.

676
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:59,739
Bad management.
Good thing I'm back.

677
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,659
Ryan, coffee.

678
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,955
I don't do that stuff anymore.
No. It's for me, bimbo.

679
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,082
Kids.

680
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,168
So I'm back

681
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:15,751
and I am never, ever,
going to leave.

682
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:19,384
I am going nowhere.

683
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,805
This place is like

684
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,976
the hospital where I was born,

685
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,562
my house,

686
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,690
my old age home

687
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:38,194
and my graveyard for my bones.

688
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,282
Did Karen get the job?

689
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,744
Back to work.
Still waiting on that coffee.

690
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,387
Pam, hello.
Dwight, hello.

691
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:08,971
I wanted to thank you
for helping me

692
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,978
when you held the title

693
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,271
of secret assistant
to the regional manager.

694
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,945
You served the office
with great dignity.

695
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,996
No, I don't know
what the future holds.

696
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,666
But I'm optimistic

697
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,254
and I had fun goofing around
with Dwight today.

698
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:42,467
Jim and I
are just too similar.

699
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,137
Maybe one day
I'll find my own Karen.

700
00:37:47,681 --> 00:37:51,309
But, you... That is a...
You know, not...

701
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:54,271
A man. A man version.

702
00:37:55,731 --> 00:38:00,231
But until then,
I can hold my head up.

703
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,613
I'm not gay.

704
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,574
I don't know how I feel
about hiring a Sixers fan.

705
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,660
I should leave.

706
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:10,704
Now, let me ask you
a question, Jim.

707
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,289
You're clearly
a very bright guy.

708
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:14,332
Thanks. Always hit your
numbers, personable.

709
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:16,084
You make a great impression
on everyone you meet.

710
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,294
I'm sorry, wait.
So is the question,

711
00:38:17,377 --> 00:38:18,961
how did I get
to be so awesome?

712
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,466
Because I don't have
an answer for you.

713
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:24,759
Oh, hey, do you have
your quarterly numbers...

714
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,720
Yes. Absolutely.
...and questionnaire?

715
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,889
Sorry to make you fill that
thing out. Oh, no. Absolutely.

716
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:29,973
It's just a HR formality.

717
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,101
We have this
very irritating HR guy here.

718
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,687
He's probably the only person
you're not going to like.

719
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,772
Kendall.

720
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,777
So, first up.
There you go.

721
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,237
How do you think you'd
function here in New York?

722
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,076
What's that? Oh, great.
You know I just...

723
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,786
I really appreciate
the buildings

724
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:56,787
and the people, and there's
just an energy that New York has.

725
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,419
Not to mention
they have places

726
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,380
that are open past 8:00,
so that's a bonus.

727
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:04,549
You've been in the
Scranton branch a long time.

728
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:07,844
What have you liked most
about that place?

729
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,642
The friendships.
Okay.

730
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:15,602
Well, we want the person

731
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,605
who takes this position
to be here for the long haul.

732
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:23,109
So, long haul, where do
you see yourself in 10 years?

733
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,374
How are your feet?
Medium rare. Thanks.

734
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:44,668
The real reason that I went to
Stamford was because I wanted to be...

735
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,261
Not here.

736
00:39:50,637 --> 00:39:51,846
I know.

737
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:55,475
And even though I came back,

738
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:02,395
I just feel like
I've never really come back.

739
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,159
Well, I wish you would.

740
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,961
Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.

741
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:25,004
Just one moment.
I'll transfer you.

742
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,467
I haven't heard anything.
But I bet Jim got the job.

743
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:33,471
I mean, why wouldn't he?
He's totally qualified and smart.

744
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,140
Everyone loves him.

745
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:39,977
And if he never comes
back again,

746
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,481
that's okay.

747
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,151
We're friends. And I'm sure
we'll stay friends.

748
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:48,987
We just... We never
got the timing right.

749
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,990
You know, [ shot him down

750
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,409
and then he did
the same to me and...

751
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,579
But you know what, it's okay.

752
00:40:58,538 --> 00:40:59,914
I'm totally fine.

753
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,876
Everything is going
to be totally... Pam.

754
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,169
Sorry.

755
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,171
Are you free
for dinner tonight?

756
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:11,175
Yes.
All right. Then it's a date.

757
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,853
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

758
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,192
So I know we left the other
day on a note of uncertainty,

759
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,277
but after some more thought,

760
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,571
I'm very pleased to be able
to offer you this job.

761
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,074
Great.

762
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,702
I'm so glad. We're all very
excited you're going to be joining us.

763
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,954
It'll be nice to have
another MBA around here.

764
00:41:40,038 --> 00:41:43,791
I'm excited, too. Okay.

765
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,837
Who was that?

766
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,088
Nobody.

767
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,258
You and I are done.
What?
