1
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,843
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:11,928
Hello?

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,679
Hello. This is Dwight.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,515
Yes!
Hello? Hello?

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,266
We do have that.
Hold on one second.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,351
Jim, what are you doing?

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,769
And how many would you like?

8
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:20,937
Hang that up right now.

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,980
Absolutely. I can get that
out to you immediately.

10
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,315
This man is an imposter.

11
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,359
Do not do business with him.
This is not Dwight Schrute.

12
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:31,447
Dwight left his cell phone on his desk,
so, naturally, I paired it to my headset.

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,410
Okay, fine, I'll just let
it go to voicemail.

14
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,706
Hello, this is Dwight.
Hey, is this Dwight?

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,791
Yes, it is.

16
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:43,376
Oh, my goodness,
you sound sexy.

17
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:44,919
Oh, thank you.
I've been working out.

18
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Pam! Pam!
You are not talking to Dwight right now!

19
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,715
You are talking to Jim.
Dwight?

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,385
No! Pam, I'm over here!

21
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:53,636
I'm confused.

22
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,429
Disconnect that right now.

23
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,597
You give me
your earpiece.

24
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,808
Can't do that.
Unsanitary.

25
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,186
Okay, you know what?
Fine.

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,815
I will reprogram my phone
to go to my office phone.

27
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:09,986
Done.

28
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,323
This is Dwight.

29
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,535
Oh, and I forwarded his
desk phone to mine.

30
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,289
Oh, hello, Mother.
Good news, I have married.

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,707
Tell Father.

32
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,001
Such a nice woman.

33
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:57,533
Today is
Toby Flenderson's last day.

34
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:01,454
I couldn't sleep last night.
I came in extra early.

35
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,830
So much energy.

36
00:02:02,913 --> 00:02:06,167
There are certain days that you know you
will remember for the rest of your life,

37
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,129
and I just have a feeling that
today is one of those days.

38
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:12,506
Morning.
Morning.

39
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,301
So here we go.
Just a matter of hours now

40
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,803
until his horrible-ness
has left the building.

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,514
I'm going to set
my watch alarm,

42
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,391
and...

43
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,687
Good morning, Kelly.

44
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,565
I can't believe this is your
last day. How do you feel?

45
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,400
Fine. Good.

46
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,568
I feel weird.

47
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,364
First thing on the agenda, actually,
the only thing on the agenda,

48
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,449
is the status of Toby's
going-away party.

49
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:40,451
We have a butter-cream cake

50
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:42,161
and a slide show of Toby.
Okay.

51
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:44,914
But so far we only have
two pictures of him.

52
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,999
Okay.
Well, this will not do.

53
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,586
Toby is going away forever,

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,381
and we need to do something
very, very special.

55
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,132
In some cultures,
when somebody leaves,

56
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,718
like New Orleans' culture,
they have a parade,

57
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,554
and they have a band, and
people party in the streets.

58
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,807
Do you mean leaves
as in dies?

59
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,351
You want us to throw Toby
a New Orleans funeral?

60
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:10,314
If the devil were to explode,
and evil were gone forever,

61
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,733
what sort of party
would you have?

62
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,859
Michael...

63
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,194
Like a beach blowout,

64
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,862
or a toga, a toga.
No, you know, no.

65
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,906
Toga!
You always do this.

66
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,077
We have a nice, modest party planned,
and then you come in and demand the world.

67
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,997
Let me be clear, there is simply no
money for anything other than a cake

68
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,208
and to develop
a few more slides,

69
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,044
although Toby
won't be in them.

70
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,255
I thought that you
might say that.

71
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:46,517
Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother
sends me a check on my birthday for $50.

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,772
And lately, she has been sending
me, like, nine or ten checks a year.

73
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,901
As Nana starts to...

74
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,738
But I knew I should be
saving it for something.

75
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,657
I just didn't know what
I should be saving it for.

76
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,576
And then I had an awakening.

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,120
Michael, my motorcycle.

78
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,999
So I put the money in my shoe,
and then I forgot about it until now.

79
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,754
I want a party that makes me
feel like I'm flying through the air,

80
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:19,884
without this ugly weight
holding me down, you know?

81
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,014
I want an anti-gravity
machine. I saw it in a movie.

82
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:28,100
You drink a potion, and then
you just start floating all around.

83
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,769
So how much anti-gravity
potion do you want?

84
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,980
No. No, you know what? This is not
a Party Planning Committee anymore.

85
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:37,026
And I don't want your foot money,
and I feel uncomfortable participating.

86
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,863
Phyllis, can you do this?

87
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,284
Yes.

88
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,000
Hi. Can I help you?

89
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,710
Hi. Yes. I'm Holly Flax.

90
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,462
I was told to ask
for Mr. Flenderson.

91
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,756
As part of my last day,
I am training

92
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,134
the new human resources rep
in the ways of the company.

93
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,014
Again, the company has
allotted for this training one day.

94
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,684
So this is HR.
This is your desk.

95
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,061
I love the view.

96
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,104
Yeah. It's great. Isn't it?

97
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,241
Hey.

98
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,367
Hey.

99
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,833
What?

100
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,335
Guess who just got into
the Pratt School of Design.

101
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,920
No way!

102
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,381
What did I say? I said that
they'd love those sketches!

103
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,216
Congratulations!
Oh, thank you.

104
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,718
I don't know why I doubted it,
because I'm so clearly awesome.

105
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,971
Yes. So,
when do you start?

106
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:48,264
I don't know.
I didn't read it carefully.

107
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:51,100
I just saw "Congratulations," and
I skimmed the list, I saw my name,

108
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:53,269
I came in here to tell
you and get a snack.

109
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,020
Wow. Busy morning.

110
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:01,026
So, you know, it means I have to
go to New York for three months.

111
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,905
It's not a big deal. I'll come
visit you, and you'll visit me.

112
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,157
It's only two hours
away. It'll be fine.

113
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,826
That part's going to suck,
but it'll be great.

114
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,786
Yeah. It sucks,
but it'll be great.

115
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,496
See how easy that is?

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,668
I wouldn't go if things
weren't so solid with Jim.

117
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,253
And down the road,
if we have a family,

118
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:23,465
I couldn't go then either,
so the timing's perfect.

119
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,637
And that is the first time I've
ever used the word perfect in here.

120
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:30,723
Hey, Stanley,
I want to introduce you...

121
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,099
Real good.

122
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,976
Toby's replacement.

123
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,020
Wow.

124
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,855
So what do we
know about her?

125
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:41,901
Well, we know that Toby
thinks she'll be great.

126
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,153
Now, strike one.
I hate her already.

127
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,487
I hate her, too.

128
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:47,448
Why do you hate her?

129
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:50,993
Because she stinks

130
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:55,581
with her ways and her head.

131
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,960
You know, Dwight, sometimes,

132
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,214
I don't know, I think you say
things just to agree with me.

133
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,507
Would that be
such a bad thing?

134
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,217
Yeah, it would.
Just have a thought.

135
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,261
Have an original thought.

136
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,265
Although, I will agree
that her head is weird.

137
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,351
You know what we need to do?

138
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:16,435
What?

139
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:18,228
We need to sell her
an elevator pass.

140
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,981
But our elevator
doesn't require a...

141
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,734
Exactly. Little
old-fashioned hazing.

142
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:29,490
Hi. Are there any local companies
that rent anti-gravity machines?

143
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:31,116
Anti-gravity machines?

144
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,242
That's right. Yeah.

145
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,286
What do they do exactly?

146
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,580
They make you feel lighter.

147
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,374
Anti-gravity...

148
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,667
Um...

149
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:44,213
Anti-depressant? I could put
you through to someone on that.

150
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:45,339
Okay.

151
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:46,799
Yeah?

152
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,133
Hey, Michael?

153
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,885
Oh, hey, do you
still work here?

154
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,221
I'd like to introduce you
to my replacement. Nah.

155
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,889
Come on.
No, I think I will pass.

156
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,557
Michael Scott, this is Holly.

157
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,101
Hi. Yeah, right.
Hi.

158
00:07:57,184 --> 00:08:00,229
Okay, well, they hired a
female Toby. Good for the world.

159
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:03,983
Thank you, God,
for creating two of you.

160
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,653
Here's how things work here.
My job is to make the office fun.

161
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:13,784
Your job is to make the office lame,
and we have an eternal struggle, you and I,

162
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,786
and only one of us
can be the winner.

163
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,163
Spoiler alert,
I'm going to win.

164
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,209
Man, someone
doesn't like HR.

165
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,335
Yeah.

166
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,920
What did you do to him?

167
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,171
Nothing.

168
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,633
No, he tortured me
with his awfulness.

169
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,844
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

170
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:35,097
I nearly fell asleep when
he gave me a tour of the files.

171
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,393
Well, look, I'll let
you get back to work,

172
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:42,563
but I really look forward to
working with you, Mr. Scott.

173
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,898
You can... Michael.

174
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,780
Thanks to Toby, I have a very
strong prejudice against human resources.

175
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,409
I believe that the department is
a breeding ground for monsters.

176
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,705
What I failed to consider, though,
is that not all monsters are bad.

177
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:02,332
Like E.T.

178
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:07,421
Is Holly our
extraterrestrial? Maybe.

179
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:11,800
Or maybe she's just an awesome
woman from this planet.

180
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,304
The pleasure's all mine.

181
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,472
Thanks.

182
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,474
I'm really looking forward
to sitting down with you

183
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,392
and finding out more
about what you do here.

184
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,477
Any time,

185
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,770
Yeah. What do you do here?

186
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,941
Excuse me.

187
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,486
What is wrong with this woman?

188
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,280
She's asking about stuff
that's nobody's business.

189
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:34,531
What do I do?

190
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:39,453
Really, what do I do here?
I should have written it down.

191
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,413
Qua-something.

192
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:47,628
Qua... Quar...
Qua... Qual... Quar...

193
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:50,047
Quabity. Quabity assuance.

194
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,633
No, no, no, no,
but I'm getting close.

195
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,885
Have you been
introduced to Kevin?

196
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,470
No. Which one's Kevin?

197
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,438
He's here on a special work program.
He's slow, you know, in his brain.

198
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,607
Oh, good for you guys.
Yeah.

199
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,278
Hazing is a fun way to show a new
employee that she is not welcome or liked.

200
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,324
Accounting department, listen
up. Holly, human resources.

201
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,118
Angela, Oscar and Kevin.

202
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,702
Hello. Hello.

203
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,372
Hi.

204
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:25,332
What do you do?

205
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:26,583
I do the numbers.

206
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,002
Oh, good for you.

207
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,298
Do you want an M&M?

208
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,009
Oh, no. That is so sweet.
Thank you, though.

209
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:41,140
Yeah. I keep them here at my desk,
so that everybody doesn't take them.

210
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,851
Well, that is a very
safe place for them.

211
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,270
Yeah.

212
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,147
Here she is, Holly.

213
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,818
You know, if we hung
Holly from the ceiling,

214
00:10:52,901 --> 00:10:54,987
we'd have to kiss
underneath her.

215
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,781
So, I know. Oh, sorry.

216
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:02,035
Question, are you real,
or are you a Holly-gram?

217
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:07,082
Nice. I've never heard
that one before, actually.

218
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,584
That's good.
I bet.

219
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,253
Are these guys
boring your ears off?

220
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,754
Oh, no, no, I...

221
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,383
What is your commute like?
How long does it take to get in?

222
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:19,469
Oh, uh... You know, I
should make you a mix.

223
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,599
Do you have a CD player?

224
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,934
Um... Yeah. Okay.

225
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,102
All right.
Thanks.

226
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,478
Great.

227
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,063
Do you like it?

228
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,650
It's a photo of everyone in the
office, so you can take it to Costa Rica.

229
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,776
You're not in it.

230
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,570
Well, I was taking
the picture.

231
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:39,615
I love it. I love it.

232
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:46,830
I would love a picture of the two
of us to also take to Costa Rica.

233
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,166
Sure. Do you have
a camera here?

234
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,335
Uh...

235
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,795
Does anyone have
a camera here?

236
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,133
No one has a camera here.

237
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,510
Okay.

238
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,095
I'm going...
I'll go get one. I'll just...

239
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:11,438
So I just got the fax.
Closing the sale, and it's big.

240
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,648
It is really big.

241
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,774
Congratulations.

242
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,275
Thanks...
Don't interrupt.

243
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,487
Congratulations on doing your job.
Did you enter the sale on the Web site?

244
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,030
Nope, I didn't.
I just logged it in...

245
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:22,199
All right, try to be
a team player here, Jim.

246
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,617
Log it in the Web site.

247
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,993
All right, well, it already
went through, so...

248
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,120
Don't worry about that.
Just re-log it.

249
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,830
Hello?

250
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:36,296
Hmm...

251
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,464
Jim?

252
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:45,472
I am downloading some N3P...

253
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,015
That's not it.
...music...

254
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,518
...for a CD mix tape...
Yep.

255
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:50,894
Close.
...for Holly.

256
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,815
And I'm looking for perfect
songs that work on two levels.

257
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:56,024
What are the two levels?

258
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,735
The two levels being,
welcome to Scranton,

259
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,029
and I love you.

260
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,950
Okay, let's start with
the "I love you" level.

261
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:09,037
Hey, what's the group that was
from Scranton and made it big?

262
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,664
Was that U2?
Yes.

263
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,624
You don't love Holly.

264
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,792
I think I do.

265
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,876
But you just met her.

266
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,254
Well, it's love
at first sight.

267
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,049
Actually, it was... No, it
was when I heard her voice.

268
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,218
It was love at first
see with my ears.

269
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,137
Okay. It doesn't
work like that.

270
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,889
Well, not a romantic.

271
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,182
Actually, I think I am.

272
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,686
And I have a little bit of
experience in office romance.

273
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:33,854
Oh, really?
Yeah.

274
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,439
Like with who?

275
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:36,940
We've been through this.

276
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,025
Pam?

277
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,278
Yes. We are still dating,
and guess what, I took it slow.

278
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:42,738
Yeah, you took it too slow.

279
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,947
Well, we're really happy.

280
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:48,744
This thing with Holly
feels a lot like love to me.

281
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,204
And that's really sweet,
and you can think that,

282
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,666
but you don't say that out loud,
and you definitely don't say it to her.

283
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,418
I don't want her to get away.

284
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:01,423
I know. Here, Michael, you can court
her as you get to know her, you know?

285
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,092
I mean, the office is
a great place for that.

286
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,595
Pam and I, we got to know
each other right out there.

287
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:10,515
I mean, the first time we
joked around was at my desk.

288
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:15,520
And the first meal we ever had
was in the break room, actually.

289
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,191
We were at two separate
tables, and I remember that.

290
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:23,320
The first time we kissed,
even, was right outside and...

291
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,909
Look, all I'm saying is that you can
get to know someone really, really well,

292
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,204
like I did,
right here at work.

293
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,753
I was thinking fireworks for
the party. What do you think?

294
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:42,130
Oh, boy. I appreciate
your help, but I can't...

295
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:46,510
No, no, no. I just meant I wanted
to pay to have fireworks at the party.

296
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,261
Why would you do that?

297
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,348
Because I'm going
to miss Toby.

298
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:55,811
Yep. He's a heck of a guy, and I
think we should send him off right.

299
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,021
Doesn't matter. Here you go.

300
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,943
Really?

301
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:04,486
Well, we all want
a good party, right?

302
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,740
I'm going to
propose tonight.

303
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,743
Holy crap.

304
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,342
Hey, Kevin.
Hi.

305
00:15:28,051 --> 00:15:29,928
Do you need some help?

306
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,805
I can't decide what to get.

307
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,766
Well, what do
you like to eat?

308
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,602
Well, I like pretzels,

309
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,231
but I really like chips.

310
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:42,732
Hmm.

311
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:45,402
Well, how much money
do you have there?

312
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,447
Okay, let's see.

313
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,534
Fifty... This is a button.

314
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,498
Fifty-five, sixty-five, okay,
you have seventy-five cents

315
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:04,004
so that means you could get
anything up in the top row.

316
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:07,966
Hmm.

317
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:14,181
I'm totally going
to bang Holly.

318
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,351
She is cute and helpful,
and she really seems into me.

319
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:20,854
Hey, Ryan. It's Jim.

320
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:22,606
Look, man, I don't know
what's gotten into you lately,

321
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,065
but you know what?
I really don't care,

322
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,734
because you're
trying to get rid of me,

323
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:29,196
and I bet you think I don't care enough
about this job to actually fight back,

324
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,573
but you're wrong,
because I do, and I will.

325
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,700
So you can keep trying to
push me out of this place,

326
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:36,369
but guess what,
I'm not going anywhere.

327
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:50,800
Damn it.

328
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,387
Hello, Holly.

329
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:58,600
Whoa, what are you
doing? You don't...

330
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:01,561
You don't have to do that. I mean,
we have already-put-together chairs.

331
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,730
That's how we buy
them, actually.

332
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,527
Trying to adjust the lumbar
support on Toby's chair,

333
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,946
and that made this
up-down lever thing not work,

334
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,281
and then I took the
whole chair apart,

335
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,202
and that is the story
of me on the floor.

336
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,829
It's pretty good, right? Yeah,
I'm going to sell the movie rights.

337
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,999
And the sequel, woman
stands at desk and works.

338
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:31,675
So, I have no idea
how you sit like that.

339
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,385
Yoga.

340
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,556
Sit on floor
and put together chair, we will.

341
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,397
Yoda.

342
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:53,280
Pass
curvy metal piece, you will.

343
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:05,041
So are you in town this
weekend? Because I'm not.

344
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,836
I'm not going to be in town.

345
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,338
I'm going out of town.

346
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,632
Oh, so you can't
make my orgy?

347
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:15,427
Kidding.

348
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,681
Kidding. Acting.

349
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:20,765
Acting.

350
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,684
Acting.

351
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,020
Lovitz.

352
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,105
Yeah.

353
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,317
I did it.

354
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,860
What did you do?

355
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,361
I talked to her. Holly.

356
00:18:33,778 --> 00:18:39,367
Just pleasantries, nothing, you know,
not like, "Do you want kids?" or religion,

357
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,494
or "What side of the
bed do you want?"

358
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,372
Hey, I can take either side
of the bed at this point.

359
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,291
Wow. Okay, so how
did that feel?

360
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:47,959
It was hard.
I wanted to kiss her.

361
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,794
I'm so glad you didn't.

362
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,882
Laying a base.
Laying a base.

363
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,258
There you go.

364
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,053
There's plenty
of base-lying left, right?

365
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:01,014
Yeah.
Hey.

366
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,267
Hello, Angela.

367
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,520
Phyllis. You look like you're
going to have a heart attack.

368
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,689
Can I get a list
of your vendors?

369
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,858
I shredded it.

370
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:13,109
Why would you do that?

371
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,654
Gosh, I just don't know.
Why do you think?

372
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,786
Sorry.

373
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:28,375
What did you guys do?

374
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,878
Oh... There he is. I thought
you had gone home already.

375
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,798
Why don't you go home
and come back for the party?

376
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,886
Well, we still have to
do the exit interview.

377
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,766
Yes, we do.

378
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,476
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

379
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,062
I've been very much looking
forward to this moment.

380
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:53,608
Very, very much. I have
been steeped in anticipation.

381
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,447
Toby has been cruising
for a bruising for 12 years,

382
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,117
and I am now
his cruise director,

383
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,994
and my name is
Captain Bruising.

384
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,372
Wow, thanks, Michael,
I didn't expect you...

385
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,959
Can I just say that
of all the idiots

386
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:14,421
in all the idiot villages
in all the idiot worlds,

387
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,507
you stand alone, my friend.

388
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,633
Hello.

389
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,094
Hey. Hi. Good to see you.

390
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,220
Here?

391
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:24,180
I'm just having
a little exit interview.

392
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,099
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm here.

393
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,017
No, no, no.
This is very boring stuff.

394
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,228
Why don't you take a tour?
Have you seen the bailer?

395
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:32,731
No, no. I'll look
at it later.

396
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,817
It's part of my job.

397
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,571
Okay.

398
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,906
Did you need me
to take notes?

399
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,241
Hey, Pam, stay.

400
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,451
Okay.

401
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,246
Um...

402
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,417
All right, well,
then I will proceed.

403
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:56,755
I just have some questions
that I was going to ask.

404
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,426
Um...

405
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,557
Who do you think you are?

406
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,521
I'm Toby.

407
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,566
Yeah. Correct.

408
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,486
Um...

409
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,322
What gives... What...

410
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,116
What gives you the right?

411
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,663
I brought the binder. Do
you want to take a little look?

412
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:34,083
Sure. You know what? That
sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.

413
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,711
Here we go.
Thank you.

414
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:44,677
"What would you improve
about Dunder Mifflin?"

415
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,304
At this point...
No, no, no, no.

416
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:47,931
I've got some ideas,
I guess. No, no, no.

417
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:50,350
I'm not asking it.
I'm just reading it out loud.

418
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,477
I'd like to hear the answer.

419
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,731
Well, let
me see. I would...

420
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:09,536
I'll kill you.

421
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,039
I guess everything's okay.

422
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:17,252
I made it this far, right?
What's the point?

423
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,796
Toby, why don't you
open your present?

424
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,131
No, no, no, no.

425
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,927
Hey! Hey! Hey! This
might not be what I think

426
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,180
that I don't even know is in there because
there are a lot of presents in my car,

427
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,307
and I don't know
which is which.

428
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,142
"Suck on this."

429
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,231
What the hell is that?
Michael.

430
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,817
That's... What do
you mean "Michael"?

431
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:46,990
That's not even my handwriting.
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

432
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,534
Who thought it
would be hysterical

433
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:52,579
to give Toby a rock
for his going-away gift?

434
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,705
You did.

435
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:55,331
You made me wrap it.
No!

436
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,333
Now, I thought it was over the
line. I just...

437
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,335
Okay. You know what that is?
You know what that is?

438
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,753
That is

439
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,716
a psyche.

440
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,888
Psyche. So that is not
my real gift to Toby.

441
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,972
So what is your gift?

442
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:13,266
My gift is forthcoming, Pam.

443
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:14,726
What is it?

444
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:19,647
I am going to give Toby...

445
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,773
Your watch?

446
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,653
Yes, I am.

447
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:29,741
That was it. How did
you know that?

448
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,492
I just knew.
How did you know?

449
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,286
Oh, that is so sweet.

450
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:36,080
Well, that's my watch.

451
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,458
Thanks. I'm going to
set it to Costa Rica time.

452
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:39,667
Hey, that's good.

453
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,170
It's the kid.
Look! Look! Look!

454
00:23:42,962 --> 00:23:45,465
Hey, it's the temp!

455
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:46,799
- Look!
- Oh, my gosh.

456
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,134
- It's the temp.
- Wow.

457
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:50,511
- Is that the police?
- Yes.

458
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,096
Well, this is what happened.

459
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,641
Ryan's big project
was the Web site,

460
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,478
which wasn't doing
so well, so Ryan,

461
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:01,940
to give the impression
of sales, recorded them twice,

462
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,609
once as office sales
and once as Web site sales,

463
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:08,196
which is what we refer to in the
business as misleading the shareholders,

464
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,823
another good term is fraud.

465
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:15,662
The real crime,
I think, was the beard.

466
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:20,833
Oh, my God. Ryan. Oh, my God.

467
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,253
I cannot wait to
visit Ryan in prison.

468
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,673
I'm going to wear my hottest
track suit and get my hair done

469
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,550
and then be like, "Hi, Ryan."
And then all the other prisoners

470
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,638
are going to be like, "Damn,
Ryan, you got a hot ex-girlfriend.

471
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:37,308
"I would never have treated her so
bad when I was outside of prison."

472
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,269
Would you do me a favor
and connect me to Ryan?

473
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,729
Absolutely.

474
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,362
Right to voicemail.

475
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:53,116
Hey, Ryan, it's Jim.
You know what?

476
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,909
Totally disregard
that last voicemail,

477
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,495
because you obviously
have your hands tied.

478
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:59,080
Good luck.

479
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:02,333
What's protocol on this?

480
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,794
I normally do
nothing, I guess.

481
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,215
You shouldn't...

482
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,760
Michael, are you okay?

483
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,013
I'm just worried
about my friend.

484
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,056
Oh, God, of course you are.

485
00:25:17,223 --> 00:25:19,475
Just... I'm fine.

486
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,352
I'm holding it together.
I have a business to run.

487
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,312
No, hey, stop.
I'm cool.

488
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,232
You can let yourself be
upset. He's your friend.

489
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,694
Look,

490
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,197
you know what I usually find?

491
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,535
Holly is sweet
and simple, like a lady baker.

492
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:42,123
I would not be
surprised to find out

493
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:45,084
that she had worked in
a bakery before coming here.

494
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,170
She has that kind of warmth.

495
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,341
I'm pretty sure she's baked
on a professional level.

496
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:56,387
Whoa.

497
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,224
Cool. A bouncy house.

498
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,477
Kevin, take your
shoes off first.

499
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,316
No anti-gravity
machine, huh?

500
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,735
Sorry, Michael. I don't
think they're real.

501
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:12,737
Ferris wheel's pretty
cool, though.

502
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,448
Wow. Look at
our parking lot.

503
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:16,949
Yeah. Who would
have thought?

504
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,086
Is Jim going
to propose tonight?

505
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,589
He is, isn't he?
No, he's not.

506
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,925
Is he?

507
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:37,053
It was a pretty good company,
but I just couldn't see a future there.

508
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:39,597
They kept hiring
from the outside.

509
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,683
It was easy to get in,
but impossible to rise up.

510
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,812
That's what she... A
lot of places are like that.

511
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,482
I think it's really cool
you hired Kevin.

512
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:50,608
Thanks.

513
00:26:52,735 --> 00:26:54,445
Do you have it?
Almost.

514
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,409
Here we go, here we go.
Put it in!

515
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,497
I like...
That's my car.

516
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,209
Hey, what are you doing?

517
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:12,046
Mose! What the hell
is going on here?

518
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,297
Nothing you need
to know the details of!

519
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,007
There is a raccoon in
the car! No, there's not.

520
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,093
Dwight,
why did you do that?

521
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:18,302
It was playful hazing.

522
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,139
No! There's no such thing
as playful hazing.

523
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,975
Dwight, I want you to
look at Holly right now.

524
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,894
Everybody, I want you to
look at Holly right now,

525
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,482
and maybe if you look at her deeply
enough, you'll see what I see in her,

526
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:36,112
and that is that we are all
very lucky to have her here.

527
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:41,868
Holly is the best thing that
has happened to this company

528
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,537
since World War Ill.

529
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,497
Fifty years.
She is the best.

530
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:50,084
Take care of that,
all right?

531
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,252
- It's not rabid.
- Shh!

532
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,963
Thanks for
bringing that up.

533
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:55,381
Get it out. Come on.
Get it out. Get out.

534
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,757
I'm really sorry.

535
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:00,386
Michael, thank you so
much for saying that.

536
00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:02,930
I feel so welcome here.
I just...

537
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:09,687
Excuse me.

538
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,985
Did you see that? Did you
see it? Did you see what...

539
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,862
Wowee.

540
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,324
Well, Jan didn't believe
in showing affection,

541
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:25,620
so sometimes I don't know how
to react when a girl touches me.

542
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,079
Oh...

543
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:28,748
I like it.

544
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,879
Hey, Mrs. Vance,
we're all out.

545
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:36,380
Hey, Kevin.

546
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:40,134
I need you to do me a solid and
go buy some more barbecue sauce.

547
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:42,470
Okay.

548
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,516
Cool.

549
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,560
You drive your own car?

550
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,854
Yep. This is my car.

551
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:54,148
Do you drive your own car?

552
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,442
Yep. Just like you.

553
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,195
Okay, bye.

554
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,446
Bye.

555
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,701
Kevin, I'm really
proud of you.

556
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,961
All right, let's hear it
for Darryl and his band.

557
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:20,132
You know what, let's also give a shout
out to Phyllis for this awesome party.

558
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,386
Probably
the best one that we have ever had.

559
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:28,224
But the real reason that we
are here is to say goodbye

560
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:32,186
to a guy who we will probably
never ever see again.

561
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,606
Now, a lot of you know that I
am an accomplished song writer.

562
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,691
Song parody writer.

563
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,402
I've done things like
Beers in Heaven.

564
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:40,486
Classic.

565
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:42,280
Or Total Eclipse of the Fart.

566
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,739
Not my favorite. I like
that one. I like that one.

567
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,910
I love to sing them, but I am
not going to be doing that today.

568
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,789
I am going to be doing something
I wrote specifically for Toby.

569
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:56,043
Do you know Goodbye Stranger,
Supertramp?

570
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,295
Yeah.

571
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,589
It was early
morning yesterday

572
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:03,926
I was up before the dawn

573
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,307
And I really have
enjoyed my stay

574
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,310
Toby must be moving on

575
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:20,151
I'm going to miss Toby. He has a
nice calming presence in the office.

576
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,236
Goodbye, Toby

577
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,450
It's been nice
Hope you find your paradise

578
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,661
Don't tell him I said this, but I
always thought he was kind of cute.

579
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:35,166
Come tomorrow, feel no pain

580
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,836
Feel no pain

581
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,381
Toby

582
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:47,887
Toby, Toby, Toby's going away

583
00:30:48,387 --> 00:30:52,266
See ya! He's out of here
See ya! He's out of here

584
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,688
Goodbye, Toby! Goodbye, Toby!

585
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,901
Goodbye, Toby! Goodbye, Toby!

586
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,444
Not bad.

587
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,571
Oh, hey, thanks.

588
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:07,698
Someday I would love to hear
Beers in Heaven.

589
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,116
Oh, okay. Yeah.

590
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,330
Well, actually, too soon.
It's very sexual.

591
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,333
Sorry.

592
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,877
Kevin.

593
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:23,381
Kevin, where are you?
You missed my song, buddy.

594
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,634
Yeah, Michael I'm at Gerrity's.
You have to come down here.

595
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:28,886
Just pay for it, and we'll
reimburse you when you get back.

596
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,679
No, I brought my money.

597
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,723
Michael, there's something
that you need to see.

598
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,642
What is it?
Just hurry.

599
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:37,269
Is he okay?

600
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,396
Yeah, he's at the
supermarket.

601
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,272
He needs me.
You know, the party,

602
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:43,150
driving to the supermarket.
It's a big day for him.

603
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,361
Yeah. That's true.

604
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:49,198
Don't move a muscle. I will
be back momentarily. All right?

605
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,119
You can drink, finish your drink,
and then I'll... Okay, I'll be back.

606
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,711
Well, it was
good to see you.

607
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,921
It was great to
see you, Jan.

608
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,047
Yeah. So...

609
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,175
Okay. Hello, Jan.

610
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,927
Oh, hello, Michael.

611
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,846
Wow, Kevin, really?

612
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,849
We're... Sorry, we're
in the middle of a party.

613
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,058
Is this why you
called me down here?

614
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,394
Yeah. Michael, I just...

615
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,730
I think you kids have
a lot to catch up on.

616
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,982
Okay.
Yeah.

617
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:24,608
Thanks, Kevin.

618
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,410
Wow. I can't believe it.

619
00:32:34,493 --> 00:32:35,911
Look at you.

620
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:37,663
Are you nauseous?

621
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:39,415
Do you have cravings?

622
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:41,625
You never touched my Propecia
or my Accutane, did you?

623
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,751
No, I...
Good.

624
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,296
Good. Thank God, because
that's... Didn't touch that.

625
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,716
Wow. I am so happy.
I am so deliriously happy.

626
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,468
Why?
Because you are pregnant.

627
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,094
Yeah. And because
it obviously happened

628
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,014
when we were together,
and I am very...

629
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,765
Yeah, it did happen...
...proud.

630
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,728
...when we were together.
That's true, and... But you

631
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:03,731
are not...

632
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,442
You're not the dad.

633
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,786
You cheated on me

634
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,624
when I specifically
asked you not to?

635
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:25,503
No, I did not...
I did not cheat on you.

636
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,671
I did not.

637
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:33,886
Well, okay, so it's not mine,
and it's not somebody else's, so...

638
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,847
I know

639
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,934
the whole toilet seat
thing is a myth, so...

640
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,520
I went to a sperm bank.

641
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,940
You did?
Yeah.

642
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,566
When we were going out?

643
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,817
Yeah.

644
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,489
I don't understand. You
always used to be very cautious,

645
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:55,491
wearing two condoms.

646
00:33:55,574 --> 00:33:56,659
I know.

647
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:59,161
You would rather have somebody
else's sperm than my sperm?

648
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:02,581
No. No, no. It's not
just any sperm bank.

649
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,585
I mean, it's really... This is
a really, really great place.

650
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,296
It's amazing, actually. I'm
going to bring you the catalog.

651
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,965
You should look through it.

652
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,301
It's... In fact, it's right next
to that little breakfast place

653
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,054
that you like in the city, where
you can draw on the tables.

654
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,305
IHOP.

655
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,473
IHOP.

656
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,561
If I was 22, and I had lots of
time to have lots of children,

657
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,688
then, sure, let's let Michael
have a shot at one of them,

658
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:28,023
but honestly, I need to
make this one count.

659
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,277
Oh, that's really good.
I feel so much better.

660
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,904
I just needed to get all
of that out on the table.

661
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,364
I'm glad you told me.

662
00:34:35,447 --> 00:34:37,533
Look, I don't know what you're
going to be doing tomorrow,

663
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:42,997
but I have my Lamaze class in
Allentown, and you could come.

664
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,585
I usually, you know, use a
foam noodle instead of a partner.

665
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,297
Um...

666
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,716
I'll... I have to
think about it.

667
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,677
Okay.

668
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:03,058
My whole life I have
known two things.

669
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,021
I love sex,
and I want to have kids.

670
00:35:07,187 --> 00:35:10,733
And I always thought that those
two things would go hand in hand,

671
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,611
but now I think it might
be one or the other.

672
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,239
Oh, look, they're starting.

673
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,051
Well, I hope you
had fun today,

674
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,678
because you are never ever
throwing a party again.

675
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:04,578
Hey.

676
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,830
Can I have your
attention, please?

677
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,542
I was waiting for the
right time to do this,

678
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,754
and [ can't think of a better
time than right now.

679
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:17,007
With the music playing
and all our friends around

680
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,219
and fireworks going off.

681
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:23,722
My parents are here,
Andrew and Ellen Bernard.

682
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,142
Thank you for sharing
in this joyous moment.

683
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,688
Ms. Angela Martin, will
you please join me on stage?

684
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,359
Okay. Then I will come
to you, my flower.

685
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:38,487
Damn it!

686
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:46,620
Angela, will you
do me the honor

687
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,835
of giving me your tiny
hand in marriage?

688
00:37:01,927 --> 00:37:03,053
Okay.

689
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,472
<i>Into the mike, sweetie.</i>

690
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,974
I said okay.

691
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,892
She said yes.

692
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,730
And the crowd goes wild!

693
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:27,327
I've been carrying that ring
around in my wallet for six years,

694
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,913
because you don't know when
you're going to meet the right girl

695
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,040
and the moment's
going to be right.

696
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,127
And tonight,
with the fireworks

697
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,840
and the music and
everything, it was right.

698
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,009
Can I be your bridesmaid?

699
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:43,135
No.

700
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,268
Well,

701
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,688
it was my own fault.

702
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,692
Tuna!

703
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,404
I'm engaged.
I know.

704
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,031
That's awesome, man.
That's great.

705
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,825
Mr. Andrew Bernard.

706
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:09,787
It's got a nice ring to it.

707
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:15,042
Hey... Hey, you know,
I just realized,

708
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,503
I don't have a picture
of the two of us.

709
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,629
Oh, yeah.

710
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:20,714
Yeah, could we?
Sure.

711
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,424
Meredith, do you mind?

712
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:24,593
This one.
Okay.

713
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,806
One, two, three.

714
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:33,060
Oh, let's do it again.
Pam, your smile is weird.

715
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,854
It's digital, so just take
as many as you want.

716
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,191
One, two, three.

717
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,486
One, two, three.

718
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:47,199
I don't know. I just... I really thought
Jim was going to propose tonight.

719
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,538
Hey there.
Hey.

720
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,831
So, you missed
something really big.

721
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:54,957
Yeah?

722
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,167
Yeah, Andy proposed
to one of your accountants.

723
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,293
Oh, wow.

724
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,711
And that's as specific
as I can be

725
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,088
on my first day, but...

726
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:03,173
Well, I can see Andy
proposing to Angela.

727
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,675
I can also see him
proposing to Oscar.

728
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:05,759
Okay.

729
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:12,683
So, you know, somehow after all
those ribs, I'm still really hungry.

730
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,353
I don't know, I was thinking of
maybe going off-campus somewhere

731
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,146
and getting some dessert.

732
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,231
Oh, um...

733
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,860
Well, you know what, you
should go to the Glider Diner.

734
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:26,321
Ask Stanley about that.
He practically lives there.

735
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:27,990
Okay.

736
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:29,283
I'll go to the diner with you.

737
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:32,286
Oh, that would be great.

738
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:34,538
We can go eat pie.

739
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:35,747
I love pie.

740
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,916
Me, too.
Okay.

741
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,168
Have a good night.
Okay.

742
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,295
Night.

743
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,764
Yeah, it was a good day.

744
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,559
I mean, first days are
always the hardest, right?

745
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,979
Well, I should go.
I got to buckle him in.

746
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:05,986
Well, this is it.
I am here to see you off.

747
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,113
Thanks.

748
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,656
Really, Michael?

749
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,074
Sorry. Corporate policy.

750
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,493
It's not.
You might take something.

751
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,120
I don't think he's
going to take anything.

752
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:17,164
Okay, security guard.

753
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,168
Some kind of alarm.

754
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,794
Okay.

755
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,339
Hi, Jan. It's Michael.

756
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,468
I just... I just want
to let you know

757
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:33,680
that I am going to go
to your Lamaze class tomorrow,

758
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,435
and if there's any details
you need to fill me in on,

759
00:40:38,518 --> 00:40:42,856
like what exactly Lamaze is,
that would be great,

760
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:46,485
and I will see you
tomorrow morning.

761
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:55,118
I am going to be
kind of a daddy.

762
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,586
Party planning's a real high,
like a runner's high.

763
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:21,103
Oh, God!
What?
