1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,464
This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,966
Do you have any idea what
time we'll get out of here?

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,220
Nobody likes to work late,
least of all me.

4
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:15,306
Do you have
plans tonight?

5
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,432
No, I don't.

6
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,101
Remember when you told us not to
make plans, 'cause we were working?

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,770
Yes, I remember.

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:22,647
Hmm.

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,691
This is BS. This is BS.
Why are we here?

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,278
I am gonna call corporate.
Enough is enough. I'm...

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,574
God, I'm so mad! This is
Michael Scott, Scranton.

12
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:36,744
Well, we don't want
to work. No, we don't!

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:39,372
It's not fair
to these people!

14
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:42,917
These people are my friends,
and I care about them!

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,585
We're not gonna do it!

16
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,173
Everybody, I just got off
the horn with corporate,

17
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:54,178
and basically I told them where they could
stick their little overtime assignment.

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,846
Go enjoy your Friday.
Thank you, Michael.

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,056
All right.

20
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,182
All right.
Happy Friday.

21
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,351
Well, I think we dodged a
bullet, there. I think you did.

22
00:01:00,434 --> 00:01:01,894
I think we should
celebrate.

23
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,231
How about you, Pam, mi casa.
A little dinner, dancing, drinks?

24
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,109
Oh, I... You said
you didn't have plans.

25
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,696
That's what you said.

26
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:15,866
Michael has asked Pam and
me to dinner at least nine times.

27
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,786
And every time, we've
been able to get out of it.

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,540
But I've got to give
him credit. He got me.

29
00:01:22,623 --> 00:01:24,959
Because I'm starting
to suspect

30
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,503
that there was no
assignment from corporate.

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,547
Michael, what time
should I be arriving?

32
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,924
Dwight, it's couples only.

33
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:37,221
And besides, I only have six wine glasses.
So it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim.

34
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,098
And Angela
and Andy.

35
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,600
Hey, oh!

36
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,980
Does it bother me that I wasn't
invited to Michael's dinner party?

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,438
- Hi.
- Hello.

38
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:29,565
How are you??
Come on in.

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,609
Good to see you.
Chilly, huh?

40
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,486
I'm so glad
we finally...

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,612
Finally got to do this
with you guys.

42
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:36,614
This is great.

43
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,200
You want to take
their coats, babe?

44
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,451
Yes, I would.
Okay.

45
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:43,913
All right. So, what
have you been doing?

46
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,956
Let's see, since I saw
you an hour ago? Yeah!

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,709
I have been getting ready,
and then driving over here.

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,836
Well, we've been doing
pretty much the same thing.

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,838
Really?
Except driving.

50
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,841
We got you this.

51
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,093
Pam!

52
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:58,260
Thank you. That's
so nice. Thanks.

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,054
This will be great
to cook with. Really.

54
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:03,015
Well, have a seat,
or come on in, or...

55
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:06,852
I don't know, make yourself
to home. This is our casa.

56
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,062
- It's really nice.
- It's great.

57
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:09,772
So, what do you guys think?
Should we do the tour first,

58
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:11,399
should we have
appetizers first?

59
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,484
Tour. Let's do
the tour first. Okay.

60
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,528
You have a preference,
babe? Upstairs first?

61
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,988
Totally your call, babe.
All right, well, let's go, then.

62
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,949
All right.
I say upstairs.

63
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,618
You guys doing
a little construction?

64
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,954
Oh, just redoing
the sliding glass door.

65
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:31,293
Yeah, so sorry about this God-awful
carpet. We are still a work in progress, here.

66
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,295
This is my office.

67
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,131
Yup. Never been used.

68
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:36,882
Not super-exciting.
No.

69
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,218
And this is my work
space. - This is it.

70
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,428
Check that out.
You smell that?

71
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,554
Uh-huh.

72
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:45,057
As you can smell, there's a lot
of different odors going on in here.

73
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,059
So you have an office
and a work space.

74
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,646
I do, you know. I just... I
cannot create in the same space

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,983
that I conduct business. I'm sure
that you're the same with your doodles.

76
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,109
Smell.

77
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,320
It's fire.
Bonfire.

78
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,697
Bond!
Men love this one.

79
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,368
James Bond-fire!
"I am Bond-fire... James Bond-fire."

80
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,911
Michael Scott!

81
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:10,666
When I get frustrated,
or irritated or...

82
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,669
Angry, I come up here and
I just smell all my candles!

83
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,963
And it just... Poof!
Goes away.

84
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,256
Just like that.
Just like that.

85
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,800
So this is the
master bedroom.

86
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:22,970
And these walls, they used to
be, like, white, like an asylum.

87
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:25,890
So I wanted it to be softer, so I
had it painted an eggshell white.

88
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:29,643
Guess what? White and eggshell
white are exactly the same color.

89
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,771
Babe...
Exactly.

90
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,689
I thought you said that you
were gonna tidy things up.

91
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,191
Well, I...

92
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:36,400
Shame on you.

93
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,696
What a cute bench.

94
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,364
Thanks.
That's my bed.

95
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,202
Jan has some space issues,
so I curl up on that puppy.

96
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,539
Really? 'Cause... It seems
pretty narrow and short.

97
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,876
It's actually a lot bigger
than it seems. Look at this!

98
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,920
See?
He fits perfectly.

99
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:01,217
I finally

100
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,053
broke down
and bought myself

101
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,306
a plasma TV.

102
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,726
Check it out. I actually
hung this on the wall myself.

103
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,853
That's good. I want
to show you something.

104
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,773
A lot of people in the room,
you need more space...

105
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:17,817
Voila.
Right into the wall.

106
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,901
Wow!

107
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,653
Sometimes, I will just

108
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:24,156
stand here and watch
television for hours. I love it.

109
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,078
I love this TV. And I
also built this table.

110
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,955
What is that,
chestnut?

111
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,123
No, I think that is either
pine or Nordic cherry.

112
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,250
It's pine. Yeah.

113
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,585
Michael, I'm just terrible at all
this stuff, so that's really cool.

114
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,087
- Really?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah, he tried to set up my TiVo for me,
but then I didn't have audio for a week.

116
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:46,095
If you ever need any help,
I'm just a phone call away.

117
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,388
I bet you are.

118
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,432
Well, I saw...

119
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,642
Oh, your Dundies.

120
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,353
I'm surprised they're not out on
the coffee table for everybody to see.

121
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:59,608
Well, it was between the
neon beer sign and the Dundies.

122
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,819
So I said, "Honey,
keep the trophies."

123
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:07,658
Oh, honey, I have the best trophy
right here. Aside from my Dundies.

124
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:12,162
Oh, excuse us for
just a second. I'll get it.

125
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,331
So glad we were
finally able to do this.

126
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,125
So glad we...
No. No.

127
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,294
Okay.
Tuna!

128
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,297
What's up, Tuna? We gonna
have some tuna for dinner?

129
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,008
I bet you're sick of tuna, right?
You probably have tuna every night.

130
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,302
All right.
Tuna.

131
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,762
These are for you.
Oh, how thoughtful.

132
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,265
Very nice.
Except for one flower,

133
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,809
which is for my flower.

134
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,894
Aw.

135
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,897
What am I supposed
to do with this?

136
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,941
Well, how about we do the short
tour, and then I'll start dinner?

137
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,694
Oh, I can help starting
dinner, if you need it.

138
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:46,822
Oh no, no, no, it's just the Osso Buco,
needs to braise for about three hours.

139
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,741
Everything else
is done.

140
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:52,453
Three hours from now, or three
hours from earlier, like 4:00?

141
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:56,624
You know, Pam, in Spain, they often
don't even start eating until midnight.

142
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,751
When in Rome.

143
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,628
You have a preference?
Upstairs first?

144
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,712
Whatever
you say, babe.

145
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:02,880
Follow me.

146
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:04,048
All right.

147
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:10,471
How about a toast? Shall 1?
Here's to good friends.

148
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,306
Cheers.
Cheers.

149
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,476
Mmm.

150
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,188
A sort of an
oaky afterbirth.

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
What was that?

152
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,443
Music? Should we turn
some music on?

153
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:26,236
That sounds good.

154
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,865
Do you guys remember
my old assistant, Hunter?

155
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,536
He is an excellent songwriter. Wait
until you hear this. Okay, here we go.

156
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,326
You know what?
Hunter was a terrible assistant.

157
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,494
That is why
Ryan fired him.

158
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:17,621
Well, I think he's probably
just about as reliable as Pam,

159
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,249
being that it usually takes you
an afternoon to get back to me.

160
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:23,085
Sometimes I think
she holds on to faxes.

161
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,216
I don't care what
they say about me. I just want to eat.

162
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:32,219
Which I realize
is a lot to ask for

163
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,013
at a dinner party.

164
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,766
Cow. No, it's a
hump, there's a hump.

165
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,018
Joe Camel! Joe Camel! Yes!

166
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,353
Okay, yes. First
name of that animal,

167
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:45,232
and the second name is the
state where Helena is the capital.

168
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:46,942
Montana.
Joe Montana?

169
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,736
Yes! Yes!

170
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,779
Time's up! All
right, two pieces!

171
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,489
Why didn't you just say
49ers quarterback?

172
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:57,327
All right, my...my...my...my
turn! My...my...my...my turn!

173
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,079
My...my...my...my turn!

174
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,165
Babe, can you just, like,
really... - What?

175
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,083
You're just, like, really...

176
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,543
What? What?

177
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,211
Could you just simmer
down? Seriously.

178
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,213
I'm just making
people laugh. - No.

179
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,883
Yes, I was watching Jim's
face. I was watching Jim.

180
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,010
And he was laughing.

181
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:14,386
No smile.

182
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,722
Look at him.
He's laughing.

183
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:20,726
Michael and Jan seem to be
playing their own separate game.

184
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,605
And it's called, "Let's see how
uncomfortable we can make our guests."

185
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:28,525
And they're both winning. So
I am going to make a run for it.

186
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:32,529
You'll never guess. I just got
a message from my landlord.

187
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,239
Apparently,
my apartment flooded.

188
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,991
Something with the
sprinkler. - Oh, no!

189
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,660
Pam, we should probably
get going and see the damage.

190
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,745
Oh! Okay.

191
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:42,164
Well, you don't need
two of you to do that.

192
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,251
That's true...

193
00:09:48,128 --> 00:09:49,254
Dinner sounded
delicious.

194
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,048
Pam, I'll see you at home.
Thank you so much.

195
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:54,468
Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to
abandon this party here, all by itself.

196
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,428
I don't know, because
everything I own is there.

197
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,598
You can buy new stuff, but
you can't buy a new party.

198
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:03,227
That's true. That is a great
point. Come on down here.

199
00:10:05,145 --> 00:10:09,358
Sit down on that couch
and be amongst friends,

200
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:12,945
and we're not gonna think about all
your stuff being destroyed. All right?

201
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,113
Michael, you're up.

202
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,864
Here we go.
This is gonna be fun.

203
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,032
- Ready...
- Go!

204
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,076
All right.
First name is Tom.

205
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,412
No, no, no. No names. No
names, no rhyming, no sound-alikes.

206
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,832
All right, okay. Okay.
You're getting into my head!

207
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,792
First name is blank,
and he goes on a cruise.

208
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,877
He goes on
a Caribbean cruise.

209
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,170
I don't know.
Katie Holmes.

210
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,382
No, but he's married to
her! Oh, Dawson's Creek.

211
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:36,301
No, it has to be a real
person, Jim. Come on!

212
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,054
No, no, I'm gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass.

213
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:41,181
Okay!

214
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,393
Rhymes with Parnold
Sportsanegger. No rhyming!

215
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,894
Not really a rhyme.

216
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,271
Another clue!
Another clue!

217
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:49,648
Okay, he's the governor
of California.

218
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,150
He is the Terminator.

219
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,734
Those aren't helpful.
Tom Cruise!

220
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,861
Time!
No!

221
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,738
God! Does anybody
read the paper?

222
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,708
Oh, thank you.

223
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,876
You're welcome.

224
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,890
I'm so, so sorry for
the temperature in here.

225
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:27,686
The sliding glass
door shattered.

226
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,229
It's okay. So...

227
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,192
It's actually
a really cute story.

228
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,235
Do you want to tell it,
babe, or should I tell it?

229
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,320
I don't like
that story, babe.

230
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,446
Come on!

231
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,742
It's a cute story... Michael ran
through the sliding glass door

232
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,828
because he thought he heard
the ice cream truck.

233
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,246
Stop. Stop it!

234
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,333
I mean, I like ice cream,
okay? Sue me.

235
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,752
Oh, no, don't.

236
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:54,546
I shouldn't say that jokingly,
because she will sue me.

237
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,550
She loves to sue.
She loves lawsuits.

238
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:03,680
You know, honey, that door was
extremely clean, and it looked invisible.

239
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,641
You are so right.
You are so right!

240
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,977
Because before I lived here, the
glass was always covered in smudges.

241
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,272
And I moved in and I cleaned it,
so I guess that makes me the devil.

242
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,861
You are! She is! She
is the devil! I'm in hell!

243
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,197
I'm burning.
Help me!

244
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,573
You shouldn't
joke about that.

245
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,908
Is there more wine
in the kitchen?

246
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,368
No, I will get it.
I will get it.

247
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,245
What kind of hostess would
I be if I didn't get my wine?

248
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,580
It's okay, I don't mind. No,
no, no. In fact, you know what?

249
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,541
Girls' trip. Angela,
come on. Girls' trip.

250
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,546
Oh, not even close.

251
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,799
So, you keep
a very tidy house.

252
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,969
You should see our bathroom
after Michael takes a bath.

253
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,430
But I don't have
to tell you, Pam.

254
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,266
Oh, yeah...

255
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,433
What?

256
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,229
Oh, don't tell me that he's really
changed since you guys dated.

257
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:53,605
Oh, are you joking?

258
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,818
No, Michael told me a little bit about
it, but I see the way you look at him.

259
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,237
I have never, ever dated

260
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,741
or wanted to do anything
resembling dating Michael, ever.

261
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:09,079
Not ever, not now, not then,
not now, not ever, ever.

262
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:11,206
I've noticed how you
look at him at the office.

263
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
Mmm-hmm.

264
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:20,549
So, I spend most of my
time right here. Have a hand.

265
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:23,093
So, Jim, I noticed you
checking out Jan's candles.

266
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:25,137
Oh, no, she just put it
in front of my face.

267
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,265
Yeah, did you know
that candles

268
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:32,269
are the number-one fastest-growing
product in the scent-aroma market?

269
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:36,398
$2 billion a year industry.
And for only $10,000,

270
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,277
you could become a co-owner
of "Serenity by Jan."

271
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,988
What do you think about
that? Thought about it. I'm in.

272
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:47,367
I'm sorry, are you really trying to
get us to invest in Jan's company?

273
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,244
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,497
What now?

275
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,958
Coming.

276
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,252
Hello.

277
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,754
What are you
doing here?

278
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,466
We came here to eat dinner and
to party. This is a dinner party, right?

279
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,217
Awesome!
What is he doing here?

280
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:05,677
Yes, what are
you doing here?

281
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,304
Dwight is my friend.

282
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,140
We weren't invited?

283
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:15,020
You said that I could not invite Dwight
because he was not part of a couple,

284
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:18,065
and because we didn't have
enough wine glasses.

285
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,318
Dwight brought glasses
and a person.

286
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,028
Fine.
Whatever you want.

287
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:24,654
Just like always.
Whatever you want.

288
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,282
Whatever I want?
It's never whatever I want.

289
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,494
It's fine, Michael. When
I wanted to see Stomp

290
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,661
and you wanted
to see Wicked,

291
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,538
what did we see?
We saw Wicked...

292
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,458
When I said that
I wanted to have kids,

293
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,170
and you said that you wanted me
to have a vasectomy, what did I do?

294
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,714
And then, when you said that
you might want to have kids,

295
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,717
and I wasn't so sure, who
had the vasectomy reversed?

296
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,803
And then when you said you
definitely didn't want to have kids?

297
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,179
Who had it reversed back?

298
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:51,390
Snip, snap! Snip,
snap! Snip, snap!

299
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,682
I did!
Okay...

300
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:57,938
You have no idea the physical toll
that three vasectomies have on a person!

301
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,982
And I bought this condo

302
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,776
to fill with children.

303
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,194
I am so sorry

304
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:07,489
that I don't want to bring
kids into this screwed-up world.

305
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:08,990
Okay? But look...
I'm sorry, too.

306
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:13,370
If you want to have kids, then fine,
you win. Let's have a kid!

307
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,667
Do you mean it?
You want to have a kid?

308
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,628
I hate my life.

309
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,756
So, can we come in?

310
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:33,473
Mmm.

311
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,767
Great turkey leg.

312
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,771
Okay,
I'm just gonna check on dinner.

313
00:15:43,066 --> 00:15:45,193
Angela, would you like
some of my beet salad?

314
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,736
I hate beet salad.

315
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,321
It's actually
really good.

316
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,240
Hey, hey, hey.

317
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,368
I know you love beet salad.
I've seen you eat it many times.

318
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:58,665
The thought of popping one of your beets
into my mouth makes me want to vomit.

319
00:15:58,748 --> 00:15:59,749
Pam...

320
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:04,588
I hope she didn't
do anything to the food.

321
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,590
Like what?

322
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:08,592
I can't prove it,

323
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:11,678
but I think she might
be trying to poison me.

324
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,767
Hey,
looks great, babe.

325
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,019
Yeah,
it really does.

326
00:16:19,102 --> 00:16:22,355
I know Jan
didn't poison the food. I know that.

327
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,650
But if she was going to poison
the food of someone at that table,

328
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,945
wouldn't it be me?
Michael's former lover.

329
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:39,289
Can you not do that?
It's disgusting.

330
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,919
You know I have soft teeth.
How could you say that?

331
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,212
Oops.

332
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,716
Excuse me
for a second.

333
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:58,058
So, how do you guys
know each other?

334
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,019
I was his babysitter.

335
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,939
And now you guys
are dating?

336
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:06,942
Purely carnal, that's
all you need to know.

337
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:10,070
Would you write down your
e-mail? Because I have, just,

338
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:12,239
SO many questions.
E-mail?

339
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,575
Never mind.
Okay.

340
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,080
All right.
There we go.

341
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,381
There.

342
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:34,052
Okay.

343
00:17:34,135 --> 00:17:36,596
That's nice. MICHAEL:
Everybody enjoying their meal?

344
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,350
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:42,769
How about we take the beer
sign down until our guests leave,

346
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:43,895
and then we can
discuss it?

347
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:48,608
No, no. I'm gonna leave it up. I
think it ties the whole room together.

348
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,027
Okay.

349
00:17:57,075 --> 00:18:00,036
Jan thinks Hunter's
very talented.

350
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,248
You know what? I don't
think he's that good.

351
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,958
At least he's an artist.

352
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,294
BFD, I'm a screenwriter.

353
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,505
And I'm a candle maker, but you
don't hear me bragging about it!

354
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,385
No, all you do is you get me
to try to work on my rich friends.

355
00:18:15,468 --> 00:18:17,554
For an investment
opportunity!

356
00:18:17,637 --> 00:18:20,181
Man, I would love
to burn your candles!

357
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,808
You burn it,
you buy it!

358
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,519
Oh, good, I'll be
your first customer!

359
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,396
You're hardly my first.

360
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,981
That's what she said!

361
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:43,538
That is a $200 plasma
screen TV that you just killed!

362
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,957
Good luck
paying me back

363
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,919
on your zero-dollars-a-year
salary plus benefits, babe!

364
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,927
I'm gonna get going.

365
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,179
Fine, get out of here.

366
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,597
It's getting late.
We should...

367
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,392
You know what, you guys?
She'll be out of the bathroom soon.

368
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,477
Of course.

369
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,146
Get out of my way.
I'll take care of this.

370
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,190
Okay, what seems to be
the problem, Officers?

371
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,651
Not now, Dwight. We got
a call about a disturbance.

372
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,487
No. Nope.
Nothing disturbing here.

373
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,323
Just a couple of friends
having an awesome dinner party.

374
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,991
Your neighbors say
they heard some shouting.

375
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,452
Yes, there was
screaming, but...

376
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:28,041
My girlfriend threw a Dundie
at my TV, plasma.

377
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,043
You want to
press charges?

378
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,586
Would she get
into trouble?

379
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,129
Yeah, she'd
be charged.

380
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,092
I will take the fall.
I did it.

381
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:41,304
You know, you don't have to press charges.
You could just try to be more quiet.

382
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,431
Michael!
Yes.

383
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,266
Wait, what are
you doing to him?

384
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,310
Sir, do you have any
other place you could stay?

385
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,230
Maybe with one
of your friends, here?

386
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,316
Michael can come
home with me.

387
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,152
Jim, Pam?

388
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,779
Oh, my apartment's
on fire.

389
00:19:57,862 --> 00:19:59,030
Flooded.
Flooded.

390
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,115
You people!

391
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:01,908
Come on, you're
sleeping with me. No.

392
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:03,827
I'm gonna take you
home, Michael. No.

393
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,205
All right.

394
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:08,581
Bye, babe!

395
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,334
This is the best burger
I've ever had, babe.

396
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:16,506
Babe, I should have told
you, but... I did something bad.

397
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,846
I stole this.
For you, babe.

398
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,322
One night

399
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,824
I love that.
