1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,794
I really didn't think I was gonna
have a good time, but I did.

2
00:00:03,878 --> 00:00:07,715
I totally did. I love camping.
Anything can happen.

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:11,093
Oh, it wasn't camping. It was
more of a wilderness retreat.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,386
Morning.
Michael.

5
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:15,431
Ryan invited some of the branch
managers and Toby into the woods

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:19,977
for a get-to-know-you weekend.
Michael wasn't invited.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,233
Apparently they already knew
everything they needed to know about him.

8
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,484
Did you sleep
in cabins?

9
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:29,695
Under the stars. It
was really beautiful.

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,324
You should come. Bob and I
took rock climbing lessons once.

11
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,747
Michael wasn't invited
on Ryan's camping trip.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,916
Toby went,
but Michael didn't go.

13
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,168
He wasn't invited.

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:48,089
Who went? Me, Dan from
Buffalo, Mark Chisholm,

15
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:51,968
Jack from Albany, and Ryan,
obviously. We ate so many s'mores

16
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:56,430
I finally had to say, "No more
s'mores. No more s'mores."

17
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:04,522
Ryan invited me to go on his
wilderness adventure retreat.

18
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,275
It was this amazing,
beautiful...

19
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,778
Hey. Nobody cares.
Nobody cares.

20
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,740
I need that room at some
point, so just wrap it up.

21
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:17,660
Michael wasn't invited.

22
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:42,810
Hypothetically, if I were
to ask you to go camping.

23
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,147
And... Do you know
what "hypothetical" means?

24
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,315
Not real.
Got it.

25
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,818
So if I were to hypothetically
ask you to go camping with me,

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,237
would you go?
Absolutely. Yes.

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,949
When Michael plays the
hypothetical game, I always say yes.

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,701
Really?
Yeah.

29
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,161
Oh, do you want
to go today?

30
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:02,163
And I am always busy.

31
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:05,499
Oh, I can't go today
because I'm donating blood.

32
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,794
How often can you
actually donate blood?

33
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,212
Is there a limit?
I don't...

34
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,340
Your body only
has a certain amount.

35
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,383
Well. Is that it? Or...

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,011
Yeah. Just this whole
Toby camping thing.

37
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:20,306
I don't know, seems a little
lame. I mean... How so?

38
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,434
A bunch of guys
in a tent making s'mores.

39
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:29,023
What's that? Oh, I'm
on Broken Mountain.

40
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:31,275
Here's the thing. That's
not how you go camping.

41
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,071
I think you go camping
by yourself in the wilderness.

42
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:40,201
It's not with a group of guys
frolicking around in tents. It's one guy

43
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:42,620
or two guys, If your plans change.
They're not going to change.

44
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,956
I want to do it myself.
You know, I want to go

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,125
and find out something
about myself.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,799
I want to get out of here. All the cliques
and the office politics, fluorescent lights.

47
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,425
And the asbestos.

48
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,760
I thought we had
that looked at.

49
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,262
I'm sick of it, Jim.
I'm sick of this place.

50
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:05,559
When Jan and I had satellite, we used to
watch a reality show called Survivorman.

51
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:10,940
And it was interesting because it
was about a guy who would go out

52
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:15,027
into the middle of nowhere
and just try not to die,

53
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,196
try not to get eaten
by an animal,

54
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,282
or be overexposed.

55
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:24,704
Okay, I will only need two things,
a roll of duct tape and a knife.

56
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm on it. Okay.
Thirty minutes or less.

57
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,125
Please come back.

58
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,545
Save the receipts.
Hey, what...

59
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:36,507
Let's see if any of these will
work. Hey. Hey. Dwight. Dwight...

60
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:40,094
I keep various weaponry
strategically placed around the office.

61
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:44,223
I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper
spray I had Velcroed under my desk.

62
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:50,604
People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep
weapons in the home or the workplace.”

63
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:55,693
Well, I say it's better to be hurt by
someone you know, accidentally,

64
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,237
than by a stranger on purpose.

65
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:04,869
Dwight and I are going out.
He will return later, but I will not.

66
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:08,622
I will also be taking
a personal day tomorrow

67
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,791
and perhaps the next day.

68
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,251
Do you want me to ask
where you're going?

69
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,461
No.

70
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,129
Great. Dwight will be driving me

71
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,298
deep into the Pennsylvania
wilderness. Oh.

72
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,383
Where he will
then leave me

73
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:23,971
to either die or to survive.
The choice is yours.

74
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:28,058
No. The choice is actually yours.
Are you sure you want to do this?

75
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,855
Yes. And I am leaving you in charge
of the office for the rest of the day,

76
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:35,775
and for the next several days.
Do not try to follow me.

77
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:39,445
Okay. Great. This is a very
personal, private experience

78
00:04:39,528 --> 00:04:43,365
in the wild that I wish to
share with me, myself and I.

79
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,700
Yep.

80
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,329
When I return, I hope to be a
completely changed human being.

81
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:49,413
That'd be great.

82
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,333
Do I believe that Michael
possesses the skills

83
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,085
to survive in
a hostile environment?

84
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,632
Let's put it this way.
No, I do not.

85
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,677
This is what a true
Survivorman does.

86
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,515
You simulate a disaster,
like a plane wreck.

87
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,767
You can only wear the
clothes that you have on,

88
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,478
and you can only use the stuff
that you have in your pockets.

89
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:17,107
Now In this case, this
disaster is a serial killer,

90
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,987
creepy guy who's abducted me,
and is taking me out into the wilderness

91
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,240
to leave me for dead. No. I
would never leave you for dead.

92
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,201
You would never escape. Well,
yes, I would. And I would survive.

93
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,953
I would make sure
that you were dead. No.

94
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,288
Then I would remove your teeth
and cut off your fingertips

95
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,790
SO you could
not be identified. You...

96
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,208
And they would call me
the Overkill Killer.

97
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:39,380
You are as creepy as a real
serial killer, for real. Okay...

98
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:43,092
What are you doing? I am putting
this on so I have no familiarity

99
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:44,844
with my surroundings.

100
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,513
Now this way I can't
retrace my steps.

101
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:51,308
I don't know what streets
we... Ow! What are you doing?

102
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,227
It would be better if you
were unconscious. No.

103
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,855
Here... God. Dwight,
stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

104
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,731
Do you want to do
this right or not?

105
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:02,194
Just please allow me to have
one cathartic experience in my life,

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,533
Jim, we need to order a
cake for Creed's birthday.

107
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,076
Oh, wasn't it just
someone's birthday?

108
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:11,912
Yes. Kelly's was
last week, remember?

109
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,540
I do remember, yeah.
It's birthday month.

110
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:19,545
Creed's is today, Oscar's is week after
next, Meredith's is at the end of the month.

111
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,255
Michael usually goes with
red and white streamers...

112
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:25,301
You know what? I have an idea. Why
don't we just do one big, shared party?

113
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:26,927
What?

114
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:31,599
There are 13 people working
in this office, so 13 times a year,

115
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,351
Michael gets a cake
and balloons

116
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,188
and some sort of joke gift
and makes a toast.

117
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,151
And there are two types of toasts.
One is a joke about how old you are...

118
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:46,238
Look at those wrinkles. Blacks
do crack. Not crack the drug.

119
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:51,869
And the other is something
inappropriate or horrible or both.

120
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,706
What else? He only sings the
high harmony to Happy Birthday.

121
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,211
And he is a very big believer
in surprise parties.

122
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,923
Maybe even, arguably,
possibly to a fault.

123
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,382
Happy birthday!

124
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,009
Happy birthday!

125
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,596
Happy birthday!

126
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,726
So I think, yeah, I think getting these
out of the way might be productive.

127
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:16,936
Yeah.

128
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,940
We can just have one big, fun
party. And everybody's happy

129
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,191
and nobody
wastes their time.

130
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:24,193
I don't like it.

131
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,742
Wow. You're shaking
things up a bit, huh?

132
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,494
It's a pretty good idea,
don't you think?

133
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:37,831
Do you think it's a good idea?
No. I think it's a great idea.

134
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,250
Hmm.

135
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,796
We're here.

136
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:51,512
Dwight will take my blindfold off
when we are deep in the forest.

137
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:53,472
Just the two of us
from this point out.

138
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,016
Here we go.
Just the two of us.

139
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,523
Here we go into
the wild, to the mighty forest.

140
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,735
Can you smell the trees
and the nature?

141
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,655
Keep going.
You're fine.

142
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,408
Just some bushes
and some thickets.

143
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,161
Keep going.

144
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,207
You wanted wilderness.
You got it.

145
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:22,126
You know, try sending
them another invoice.

146
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:23,544
Okay.
All right.

147
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:26,422
Oh, did you see my memo,
by the way?

148
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,051
"Let's be honest,
as fun as birthdays are,

149
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,012
"we all can use a break
from the constant cakes.

150
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,056
"So let's celebrate birthday
month in style today."

151
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,351
This is really cool.

152
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,354
Right? I was
just thinking...

153
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,440
No. Totally.
Totally.

154
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:48,110
This way we get it all out of the way
at once and it could actually be fun.

155
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:51,113
Right. Exactly.

156
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,615
I knew I could
count on you.

157
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,162
As good a spot as any.

158
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,335
What are you doing?
Stop it.

159
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,296
Dwight, just stop it.
I'm just...

160
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,716
Spin. I'm trying to confuse
your sense of direction.

161
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,307
Behold.

162
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,975
All right, good.
Thank you, Dwight.

163
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,977
Here's your knife.
Thank you.

164
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,729
And here's your duct tape.
Good.

165
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,981
All right.
Very good.

166
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,692
Okay. Yeah.

167
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,570
Good luck, Michael.
Thanks for the ride.

168
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,449
Okay.

169
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,494
Leave me be, Dwight.

170
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,707
Hey, Jim, can I have my
own cake? What's that?

171
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,375
I really prefer
Devil's Food Cake.

172
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,585
Oh, sure.

173
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:47,836
Yes.
Okay.

174
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,004
Awesome.

175
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,422
Wow.
That was easy.

176
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,341
Yeah. People like me,
I guess.

177
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,550
Jim.

178
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:56,386
I hate Devil's Food. Well,
I think Meredith was...

179
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,097
Screw Meredith.
I don't think it's fair

180
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,140
to let someone else pick
the cake on my birthday.

181
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,434
Everybody's birthday.
Today is actually my birthday

182
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,478
and I want to pick the cake.
What do you want?

183
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,396
I want pie. I want peach
pie. You want birthday pie?

184
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,523
I want a nice cobbler.

185
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,900
I'll talk to Angela and we're going
to see what we can do about a pie.

186
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,693
I don't care who you talk
to. Just make it happen.

187
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,862
It'll be Angela. You
tell her it's for Creed.

188
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,364
She'll know
what that means.

189
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,500
Day one. I'm in the interior of
the vast Pennsylvania wilderness.

190
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,379
I have brought with me
only the bare essentials,

191
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,715
a knife,
a roll of duct tape

192
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,178
in case I need to fashion a shelter
or make some sort of water vessel.

193
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:44,726
It's hot today. The sun is in
the two-thirds easterly quadrant,

194
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,149
which would make it about 2:00
in the afternoon.

195
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,526
Really beating down
on me Now.

196
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:57,281
I think that I want to get
a little more comfortable

197
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:02,411
because the sun is
depleting my resources.

198
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,664
Okay. There we go.

199
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:10,210
Watch that I don't hit
my carotid artery here.

200
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,840
I lied to Michael. I said that I
would leave him alone, but I will not.

201
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:18,594
I will remain close by to
provide unseen moral support.

202
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,429
But I will never help him.

203
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:25,475
I will let harm befall him.
I will even let him die.

204
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,228
But I will never let him
lose his dignity.

205
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,064
There we go.
Much better.

206
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:36,069
Now everything I brought
with me can be used.

207
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,488
My sport coat here

208
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:43,202
can be fashioned
into a backpack of sorts.

209
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:49,208
I'm going to wear what was
once one of my pant legs.

210
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,838
See, this is a beautiful
piece of material.

211
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,843
This can be used for all sorts
of things, some sort of kerchief

212
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:04,389
to keep my neck
nice and comfortable.

213
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,144
Jimbo.
Andy.

214
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,273
Me likey the ice cream
cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.

215
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,485
Not your birthday. Well,
I'm just saying, you know,

216
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:18,612
if you want to make
people happy, namely me,

217
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:20,447
you will have
a Fudgie the Whale.

218
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,700
All right. I'll look into
it, but the answer's no.

219
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,453
Well, okay. Harsh.

220
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,413
Just don't expect me
to show up.

221
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,875
Hey, Andy, I have some
calls to make. Loud and clear.

222
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,335
All right.

223
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,132
Pizza rolls. Okay, I'm going
to go into this office here

224
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,801
to do some work
so I will be in here.

225
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:41,969
Mushroom caps.

226
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:46,807
I am totally alone right now
with only my thoughts.

227
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,476
I love it. I'm loving it.

228
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,482
I can literally say anything I
want. No one is going to hear me.

229
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,778
Wish I could have gone
with Ryan on that cool retreat.

230
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,823
Jan has plastic boobs.

231
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,744
I have hemorrhoids.

232
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,541
Doesn't even matter.

233
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,544
Michael's a man of
great depth and passion.

234
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,132
I don't know what he's
searching for out here.

235
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,305
But I hope he finds it.

236
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,684
Lunch.

237
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,230
Well. It is a little chillier
than I had thought.

238
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,941
So I have fashioned my hat
back into my pants.

239
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,404
Several hours in, it's time for
me to find some nourishment.

240
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:46,616
Now these woods are full of
creatures that can sustain human life.

241
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,995
Things like squirrels,

242
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,248
a nice, juicy rabbit
would be delicious.

243
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,127
About two more minutes.

244
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:04,843
I have made this spear with
which I will impale my dinner.

245
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,638
And that couldn't come
a moment too soon,

246
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,225
because I have been
without food for a good

247
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,561
three hours or so.

248
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,023
Starting to feel it
a little bit.

249
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,780
It's Creed's birthday today.

250
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,493
Happy birthday to you

251
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,498
Happy birthday to you

252
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:40,128
Happy birthday, dear Creed

253
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:47,469
Happy birthday to you

254
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,389
Happy birthday, buddy.

255
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:55,394
What is Jim thinking? It's a birthday.
So what if there's a lot of them?

256
00:14:55,477 --> 00:15:01,316
Yeah. I work hard all day. I like
knowing that there's going to be a break.

257
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,111
Most days I just sit
and wait for the break.

258
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:07,906
I took an extra shot of insulin in
preparation for this cake today.

259
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:10,492
If I don't have some
cake soon, I might die.

260
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:11,701
Why don't you just
have an apple?

261
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,203
Why don't you
mind your business?

262
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:14,538
Listen,
I figured this out.

263
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:18,500
Jimmy had his birthday three
weeks ago so he doesn't care.

264
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,419
I think the power went to
his head. - Yeah.

265
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,045
Hey, Jim.
Hey, guys.

266
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:25,799
What are we talking about?
Nothing. Nothing going on.

267
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:29,302
We're talking about nothing.
Come on, gang.

268
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:37,769
Well, if you take a look
at this, I tented my pants.

269
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:42,691
I've made myself
a nice pants tent shelter.

270
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,278
And this little guy may be
Dunder Mifflin paper some day.

271
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,703
Nothing to worry about.
Just using the scope.

272
00:15:54,786 --> 00:15:58,248
Safety is on.

273
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,295
Hey, Jim.

274
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,463
Toby.

275
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,299
Hey, I just got the word
on the communal birthdays.

276
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:09,384
Great idea.

277
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,679
Oh, thanks, man.
Yeah.

278
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,143
Is there anything
I can...

279
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,978
My birthday
was two months ago.

280
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,062
Oh, okay.

281
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,772
There was no party.

282
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:27,110
What? Well, there was
but Michael scheduled it for

283
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,655
4:58 on a Friday. People
sang in the parking lot.

284
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,740
I remember that.

285
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,158
I don't know, I just
thought maybe you

286
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,744
could include me.
Seriously?

287
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:38,955
I just thought you could add me in. I
don't know what the harm in that is.

288
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,543
Toby's great. He's great. But
sometimes he can be a little bit much.

289
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:48,632
"I don't see the harm in that."
Well, it's a cake, Toby, so come on.

290
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:50,800
Okay, yeah, you know what,
we're just going to throw you in

291
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,010
because the more,
the merrier, right?

292
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:55,805
No. No way.
I am not a machine, Jim.

293
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,809
You can't just change plans willy-nilly
and expect these little magic party elves

294
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,062
to do your bidding.
We already have Devil's Food,

295
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:05,273
peach cobbler, Fudgie the
Whale, mushroom caps...

296
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,733
I'm allergic to mushrooms.

297
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,985
That's a bummer. Okay.

298
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,488
Then we need to...

299
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,449
Hey, everybody. Hi, how are you
doing? Could I have your attention, please?

300
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,660
"Cause we have to talk
about this birthday thing.

301
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,954
Conference room? Yes.
Conference room. Five minutes.

302
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:23,124
No. No. We're going
to solve it right here.

303
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,085
We're going to actually
talk about it out here.

304
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,505
So who has problems
with the birthday thing?

305
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:32,467
One, two, three, everybody.
Okay, so then we just shouldn't do it.

306
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,011
What am I supposed to do
with two cakes and a pie?

307
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,806
I'll take them. Well,
nobody's touching my cobbler.

308
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,891
Hey, Michael.
I mean Jim.

309
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,104
Yeah. Phyllis
called me Michael.

310
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:48,316
And I will always and forever
be haunted by that fact.

311
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:53,154
Under this tree, I think I
struck the mother lode.

312
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:58,451
Those are nature's
best mushrooms.

313
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:03,540
Wild, and I have to say, these
little buggers are damn tasty as well.

314
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:06,042
Stop. No. No, Michael.

315
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,671
No. No. No.

316
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,593
Get them out.

317
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:22,475
Happy birthday to you

318
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,771
Happy birthday to you

319
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:32,277
Happy birthday, dear Creed

320
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,824
Happy birthday to you

321
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,285
Yeah. All right.

322
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:44,122
Skip around the room. Skip
around the room. We won't...

323
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:47,709
Okay, all right, yikes. Don't do
that. You're going to break something.

324
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:53,423
Man became civilized for a reason.
He decided that he liked to have warmth

325
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:55,925
and clothing
and television,

326
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:59,137
and hamburgers,
and to walk upright,

327
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,682
and to have a soft futon
at the end of the day.

328
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,393
He didn't want to have
to struggle to survive.

329
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,773
I don't need the woods.
I have a nice wood desk.

330
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,109
I don't need fresh air

331
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,571
because I have the
freshest air around, AC.

332
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,492
And I don't need
wide open spaces.

333
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,328
Check it out.

334
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,583
I can also
make it the sky.

335
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:33,880
Hi, buddy.

336
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,048
What's up?

337
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,717
I'm sure glad
you're back.

338
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:39,344
You are relieved.

339
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,845
You have no idea.

340
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,682
So what did I miss?

341
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,101
Well, I tried to put all the
birthdays together at once.

342
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,894
So, terrible idea.
Oh.

343
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:52,023
Yeah. Okay, I did that.
Rookie mistake.

344
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,694
You did do it?
Yeah. Just wait.

345
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,071
Ten years,
you'll figure it out.

346
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:01,116
Well, I don't think I'll be
here in ten years, but...

347
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,743
That's what I said.

348
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,916
That's what
she said.

349
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:14,713
That's what who said?

350
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,423
I never know.

351
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:21,344
But I just say it. I say
stuff like that, you know,

352
00:20:22,303 --> 00:20:25,432
to lighten the tension
when things sort of get hard.

353
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,392
That's what she said.

354
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:30,061
Hey. Nice.

355
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,439
Really good.

356
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:37,819
Bravo, my young ward.
