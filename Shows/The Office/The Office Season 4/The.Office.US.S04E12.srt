1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,295
So, the figures show
improvement right there, Michael.

2
00:00:04,378 --> 00:00:06,004
And again...

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,010
I'll call back.

4
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:12,803
You never call back.

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,597
Every time Michael's
in a meeting,

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,556
he makes me come in
and give him a Post-it note

7
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,351
telling him
who's on the phone.

8
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:22,104
I did it once and he freaked
out. He loved it so much.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,899
The thing is he doesn't
get that many calls.

10
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:27,526
So he has me make them up
every 10 minutes.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,196
Tell him
I'll call him back.

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,783
You can't just work
200 days... - Sorry.

13
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:36,827
Oh, no, no, no. I
don't have time for this.

14
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,829
Tell him I'm
in a meeting.

15
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,165
So.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,709
You have to know how to work
this. There's no excuse for this.

17
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,836
Yeah. I can get you
a tutor if you need.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,921
Oh.

19
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:50,173
Ah, this is a very
important client,

20
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,887
but I have the most important client
sitting right in front of me, my boss.

21
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,514
So I will call him back.
Oh, no, no, no.

22
00:00:56,597 --> 00:01:00,183
Customer service is obviously
priority one. You can take the call.

23
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,353
No. Money isn't
everything, Ryan.

24
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,646
And you're my friend,
and I don't want to be rude.

25
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,773
Take the call, friend.
I refuse. No.

26
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:08,316
My house, my rules.
I insist.

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,153
I insist you take
your work calls.

28
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,156
Okay. All right, Pam, would
you put the call through?

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,664
Hiya, buddy.

30
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,117
I don't know, I just... I never
felt welcome there, you know?

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,619
That's...
It's such a boys' club.

32
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,079
Yeah. I hate that.
Good.

33
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,581
So, here's the deal.

34
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:05,916
I am on my way to
New York to be deposed

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,794
as part of Jan's wrongful
termination lawsuit.

36
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:12,589
The company fired her
for having the courage

37
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,049
to augment her boobs.

38
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,342
And they displayed

39
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,679
a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behavior.

40
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:23,263
Yes. Yes. Pattern. "Pat-turn."
My friend Pat took a turn.

41
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,395
That's how
I remember that.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,063
Could we pull over
and put down the top?

43
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:30,440
My...
I'm feeling a little...

44
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:32,651
...queasy. No, I
want it up. My hair.

45
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,153
Remember, it's not
just a pattern.

46
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:38,736
It's a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behaviors.

47
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,454
"Dis-ray." My friend
Dis Ray got new specs.

48
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:44,788
Dis Ray Spect.

49
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:49,372
My friend In-A-Pro drives a
Prius with his behind neighbor.

50
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,503
Does this
work for you?

51
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,629
Yep.

52
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:54,923
Tell them how much
you're going to get if you win.

53
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,675
Come on, Michael,
that's tacky. Million dollars.

54
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,886
4 million.
$4 million!

55
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:03,469
Man, that is a lot of guacamole!
Lot of the green. Lot of green.

56
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:07,727
That is why I have
memorized Jan's answers

57
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,606
and I've also thrown in
some "er's" and "ah's"...

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,857
No, Michael. ...just
to make it seem like

59
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,359
it's not memorized.
No, come on.

60
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,943
Perfect crime! Stop
saying ridiculous things.

61
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:18,447
He's just going to tell the truth. The
truth is very, you know, complicated.

62
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,115
So we went
over it carefully,

63
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,035
and just so that we wouldn't leave anything
up to chance or Michael's judgment.

64
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,954
Could we please pull over
and pull down the top?

65
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,705
I do not feel good.
Michael, I told you, I'm not...

66
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,999
I'm getting carsick!
...putting the top down!

67
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,626
I'm going to puke. I think
I'm going to throw up.

68
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,919
All right, fine. Just
a second. Hold on.

69
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:38,383
Hey, Schneider,
real quick,

70
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,552
what do you call a buttload
of lawyers driving off a cliff?

71
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:43,472
A good start. And I
think it's "busload."

72
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,017
Yeah, a bunch of rich
lawyers took the bus.

73
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,936
Where did you find
this guy?

74
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,480
Hey, there he is.
Hey, Michael.

75
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,065
Hey, hey.
Jan.

76
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,734
I'm glad you're here. I actually
need to talk to you for a second.

77
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,902
Yeah. Okay.

78
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,946
Can we talk off the
record as friends?

79
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,698
I would love that.

80
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:06,616
Jan has put the company
in a very tough position here.

81
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:10,123
Now, you've been with us for a
long time. Over 10 years, right?

82
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:13,668
We just want to be sure that you won't
do anything to hurt us with your testimony.

83
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,464
Do you understand?
Abso-fruitly. Yeah.

84
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll... I'll do anything
for the company. Good.

85
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,718
That is great
to hear.

86
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:22,844
It is.

87
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,974
Game, son!

88
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,350
All right,
let's run it back.

89
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,603
The warehouse got a
Ping-Pong table last week.

90
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:36,187
Now Jim comes down and plays
with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice.

91
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:38,443
My boyfriend is 12.

92
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,367
What has two skinny chicken
legs and sucks at Ping-Pong?

93
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,286
Hi, Kelly. Guess
whose boyfriend it is?

94
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,997
I don't want to guess. I'll give
you a hint, it's not my boyfriend.

95
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,041
I think it's
a guy over here.

96
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,877
I don't talk trash.
I talk smack.

97
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:57,504
They're totally
different.

98
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:00,257
Trash talk is all hypothetical,
like, "Your mama's so fat,

99
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,425
"she could eat
the Internet."

100
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,261
But smack talk is happening,
like, right now.

101
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:08,845
Like, "You're ugly and I know it for a fact
'cause I got the evidence right there."

102
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,394
Jim? Can I see you
for a second?

103
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,104
Sure.

104
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,483
Wow.

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,069
Okay, it's not regulation
size, but it'll do.

106
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:24,614
You have to practice. You have
to get really good and beat Darryl.

107
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,491
Oh, I can't beat Darryl.
Please.

108
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,077
Kelly's trash-talking me
because Darryl's beating you.

109
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,996
What? Seriously?
What is she saying?

110
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:34,916
Your boyfriend is so weak, he
needs steroids just to watch baseball.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,502
Jim couldn't hit a Ping-Pong
ball if it was the size of the moon.

112
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:40,880
Were Jim's parents first cousins
that were also bad at Ping-Pong?

113
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,383
So, you're asking me to
defend your honor against Kelly?

114
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,260
Sort of. Yes.

115
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,554
Bring me a player.
Okay.

116
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,184
Hi, everyone. Dianne Kelly. I'm
the company's chief legal counsel.

117
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:56,480
Hi. No. No. Absolutely not.
What is he doing here?

118
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,566
Toby? Are you renewing
your divorce vows

119
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,858
before my
deposition?

120
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,610
Michael,
I'm your HR rep.

121
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,986
I'm on your side.
Never.

122
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,947
I want him gone. I
don't talk until he leaves.

123
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,449
Michael, just relax, okay?

124
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,284
You know what, I think
they're ready for us now, so...

125
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,744
Okay.
All right.

126
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,747
Mr. Scott, do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth

127
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,624
and nothing
but the truth?

128
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,751
Yes.
Mr. Scott,

129
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:21,421
can you describe the circumstances
of Ms. Levinson's termination?

130
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,214
Well, it was not
just a termination.

131
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:27,052
It was a pattern of disrespect
and inappropriate behavior.

132
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,013
Oh, very good.
Well put.

133
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,723
People underestimate
Michael.

134
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,851
There are plenty of things
that he is well above average at,

135
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,561
like ice-skating.

136
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,355
He is a very
good ice-skater.

137
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,652
Hey, Kevin,
Jim needs to see you.

138
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,195
About what?

139
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,031
He needs help balancing
some travel receipts.

140
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,033
Are you sure
he wants me?

141
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:52,661
Because I have Oscar balance
my travel receipts.

142
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,663
Yeah, no, he asked
for you specifically.

143
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,166
He's in the conference room.

144
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:05,089
Awesome!

145
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,137
How long have you
known the plaintiff?

146
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,473
I haven't
actually seen it,

147
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:14,641
but I have
seen The Firm

148
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,061
and I'm planning on renting
The Pelican Brief.

149
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,147
How long have you
known Ms. Levinson?

150
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,356
Six years
and two months.

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,817
And you were directly
under her the entire time?

152
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,902
That's what she said.

153
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:26,027
Excuse me?

154
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:27,320
That's what she said.

155
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:30,532
Ms. Levinson told you that
she was your direct superior?

156
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,368
What? Why would
she say that?

157
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,120
Can we just move on to
another question? No, wait,

158
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,247
I don't understand. Who's
on record as saying this?

159
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,916
With all due respect, I'm in the
middle of a line of questioning.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,211
Now, Mr. Scott, what did
you say Ms. Levinson said

161
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:46,965
regarding your employment status
with respect to her corporate position?

162
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,551
Come again? That's what she said? I
don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,597
If I may, he was just telling a joke before,
so can we move on to another question?

164
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,849
Oh, are you sure?
Yes.

165
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,518
Can you go back to where
this digression began?

166
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:02,105
Mr. Schneider, "And you were
directly under her the entire time?"

167
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,441
Mr. Scott,
"That's what she said."

168
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:09,196
Well, delivery's all wrong.
She's butchering it.

169
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,041
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

170
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,380
Did Ms. Levinson ever say why
she thought she was being fired?

171
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:31,801
She thought it had to do with
the twins. That's what I call them.

172
00:08:31,885 --> 00:08:34,512
Could you be more
specific. Who are the twins?

173
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,430
To be delicate,
they hang off milady's chest.

174
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:41,728
They make milk.

175
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,313
You don't need
to go any further.

176
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,648
Her breasts?
Yes.

177
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,818
She thought it had something to do with
her recent breast-enhancement surgery?

178
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:52,401
Yes. And frankly, the timing
was nothing short of predominant.

179
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,452
What about your romantic
relationship with Ms. Levinson?

180
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,955
Could that have played a part
in her termination?

181
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,332
Well, if it did,

182
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,626
then the company
is breaking its own rules.

183
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,837
Interesting.
How so?

184
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,420
Because before we started dating,
we disclosed our relationship to HR.

185
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:17,014
And I have the proof
right here.

186
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:22,435
Okay, the company has just a
few clarifying questions, Mr. Scott,

187
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,979
if that's okay with
you? I will allow it.

188
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,940
Would you mind,
please, just

189
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:31,524
taking a quick look at
this photograph, please?

190
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,826
That is you and Ms. Levinson
in Jamaica, is that correct?

191
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,952
Uh-huh.

192
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,079
And that photograph was
taken more than two months

193
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,583
prior to the start of your
relationship, does that sound right?

194
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,126
Mr. Scott, the timeline here
is actually very important.

195
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,504
Please, when did your
relationship actually begin?

196
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,924
Well, it depends
on how you define begin.

197
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,136
I mean, if it's from the first time
we shook hands, like, six years ago.

198
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,680
If it's from the first time we
kissed, it's, like, two years ago.

199
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,433
Excuse me? If it was from
the first time we kissed sober,

200
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,935
it was, like,
four months after that.

201
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:04,185
Can we take
a short break?

202
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,771
No. Are you telling me
that your relationship

203
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:11,150
began two years ago and not in February
as you previously testified to here?

204
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,447
Line.
I'm sorry, what?

205
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:18,325
He asked for a line,
like in a play.

206
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,080
"Mr. Scott, do you realize
you just contradicted yourself?"

207
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:26,624
"I did." "Yes, you did."
"Can I go to the bathroom?"

208
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,168
"No." "I really have to. I've
been drinking lots of water."

209
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,755
"You went five minutes ago."
"That wasn't to go to the bathroom,

210
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,215
"that was to get out
of a question."

211
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,342
"You still have to answer it." "First,
can 1 go to the bathroom?" "No."

212
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,183
Good game,
Meredith.

213
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,559
Don't patronize me.

214
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,562
All right, what is
going on here? Dwight!

215
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:48,897
Thank God you're here.

216
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,317
As it turns out, one of our biggest
clients is a Ping-Pong master.

217
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,861
And I have to play him
tomorrow, or we lose the account.

218
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,656
Can you help me out?
Will you help me practice?

219
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,789
What the hell?
I told you.

220
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,750
All of my heroes
are table-tennis players.

221
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,546
Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove
Waldner, Wang Tao,

222
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,964
Joerg Rosskopf and,
of course, Ashraf Helmy.

223
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:17,842
I even have a life-sized poster
of Hugo Hoyama on my wall.

224
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:19,510
And the first time
I left Pennsylvania

225
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,514
was to go to the Hall of Fame
induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.

226
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,518
Jan and I had an on-again/off-again
relationship for two years.

227
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:35,443
And I know this destroys
her case and I am sorry,

228
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:38,863
but I throw myself at the
mercy of the deposition.

229
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:42,033
Thank you, Mr. Scott.
That's all we needed to know.

230
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,368
Wait.

231
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,122
We'd like to enter into the record a
page from Michael Scott's personal journal.

232
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,540
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

233
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,250
What are you doing
with my diary?

234
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,627
This is plaintiff's
exhibit 107.

235
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,796
I quote from
an entry dated

236
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,549
January 4
of this past year.

237
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,261
"Just got back from Jamaica,
tan almost everywhere.

238
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,264
"Jan, almost everywhere.
Hee, hee.

239
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,849
"Oh, Diary, what a week.

240
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:09,853
"I had sex with my boss. I don't
know if it's going to go anywhere.

241
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,898
"Jan was very specific that
this is not going anywhere,

242
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,649
"that it was
a onetime mistake.

243
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,485
"But we had sex six times,
so you tell me.

244
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,488
"I am definitely
feeling very eerie."

245
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:21,656
Irie.

246
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,199
Irie. Sorry.

247
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:27,161
"More tomorrow.
X-O-X-O, Michael."

248
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,581
It would appear that
neither you nor Ms. Levinson

249
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,291
considered you
had a relationship

250
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,418
in any sense of the word.
Is that correct?

251
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,171
We're going to need to see a copy of
that entire journal before we proceed.

252
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,674
I don't think anyone in this
room has a right to read my diary.

253
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,967
It's basic discovery. We
have the right to review it.

254
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,387
Okay, let's make 10
copies of this diary.

255
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:45,972
Could you make it 11?

256
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,765
Eleven. Sure. And we'll break for
lunch, So everyone can have a look.

257
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,963
Can I sit here?

258
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:32,681
You know, I know a little bit about
what you're going through in a way.

259
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,985
When I was a kid,
my parents got divorced.

260
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,986
They both wanted custody

261
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,570
and they both asked me to testify
against the other one in court.

262
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:51,079
So, I don't know. I didn't want them to
get divorced in the first place, you know?

263
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,165
I love them
both so much.

264
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,835
I just wanted...

265
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,883
How could you give up
my diary like that?

266
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,219
I had to. I'm sorry,
but I need to win this.

267
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,595
We need to win this.

268
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,013
How did you
even find it?

269
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,598
You keep it under
my side of the mattress.

270
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,767
I don't like the lump. I'm
really upset about this.

271
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,562
All right, I stole your diary
and gave it to my lawyer.

272
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:18,939
You e-mailed a topless photo of
me to everyone in our company.

273
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,066
Let's call it even.

274
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,442
Fine. I love you.

275
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:22,735
I love you, too.

276
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,948
Mr. Scott, who is this
other woman, Ryan,

277
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:31,532
who you refer to here as "Just as
hot as Jan, but in a different way."

278
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,790
Not a woman, just a cool,
great-looking, best friend.

279
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,040
Aren't we trying
to determine

280
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:38,584
whether Michael and Jan were
engaged in a romantic affair?

281
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:39,960
Not Michael and
this Ryan person.

282
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,798
- Excuse me.
- All right.

283
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,966
All right, this is
the way I see it.

284
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,550
Yes, I had sex with Jan and, yes, I
did consider Jan to be my girlfriend,

285
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:54,763
however, Jan clearly did not
consider me to be her boyfriend.

286
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,479
So her actions are
completely rightful.

287
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,482
Okay, Mr. Scott,
it's admirable

288
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:05,069
the way you defend a woman
who is so obviously ambivalent

289
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,571
about her relationship
with you.

290
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,573
Thank you very much.
You didn't have to say that.

291
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,285
Considering she consistently gave
you such poor performance reviews.

292
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,790
That was before our relationship.
She was going through a divorce.

293
00:15:16,873 --> 00:15:19,000
And she was
drinking a lot.

294
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,627
Okay.

295
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,752
Of water.

296
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:26,337
Mr. Scott, this is a copy of a
particularly negative performance review.

297
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,845
Would you mind reading
the date on that, please?

298
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,684
"March 17."

299
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:39,020
And that would be a month after
your relationship became official,

300
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,480
is that correct?
Yes.

301
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,815
You may read

302
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:44,609
the highlighted portion
out loud if you'd like to.

303
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,449
"I am out of carrots.
I am out of sticks.

304
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,035
"Mr. Scott has time
and again proven himself

305
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,619
"to be an unmanageable employee
and a poor branch manager.

306
00:15:58,915 --> 00:16:01,459
"I recommend he be removed
from that position

307
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,170
"and reassigned to sales
where he belongs."

308
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:05,880
Mr. Scott,
after hearing that,

309
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,257
wouldn't you say
that Ms. Levinson's judgment

310
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:11,802
is at least very
seriously flawed?

311
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,599
Mr. Scott?

312
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,356
How's it going?

313
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,736
Well, he has gone from completely
hopeless to simply miserable.

314
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,988
Check this out,
though. Spin serve.

315
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,910
Works, like,
80% of the time, so...

316
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:36,995
Nice.

317
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,165
So, should I schedule
the rematch with Darryl now?

318
00:16:40,248 --> 00:16:41,374
I think I'm ready.

319
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,959
I'll make the call.

320
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,714
Wait a minute,
Darryl is the client?

321
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,969
No, no, no, he works
here, dumb ass!

322
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,555
Right.

323
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,141
Spin serve!

324
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:04,981
How could you
do that to me?

325
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,234
You can respond. Just remember
it's all going into the record.

326
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,446
Michael, I'm not the enemy,
okay? Dunder Mifflin is the enemy.

327
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,407
Dunder Mifflin has
always treated me

328
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,660
with the utmost respect,
with loyalty.

329
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:21,747
They were going to give me
your job, and I should have taken it.

330
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,374
All right, wait,
before you go any further,

331
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:26,335
let me show you what kind
of loyalty they have, okay?

332
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,422
Lester, please read that part
of Wallace's deposition.

333
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:32,007
Starting at paragraph six.

334
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,011
Counsel, "Mr. Wallace,
regarding Michael Scott,

335
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,305
"was he a contender
to replace Jan Levinson?"

336
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,265
David Wallace, "Yes."

337
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,849
See? I was number-one
contender. I was being groomed.

338
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,189
Counsel, "Was he
your first choice?"

339
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,775
David Wallace, "Michael
Scott is a fine employee

340
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,110
"who has been with the
company many years."

341
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:54,238
Counsel, "Was he in
the top five of contenders?"

342
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:56,449
David Wallace,
"What do you want me to say?

343
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,744
"Come on, he's a nice guy. There
were many people that I considered."

344
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,623
Counsel, "Was he being seriously
considered for the corporate job?"

345
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,667
David Wallace, "No."

346
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,591
I have one more question,
Mr. Scott.

347
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,927
Wouldn't you agree
with Ms. Levinson

348
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,014
that the company exhibits
a pattern of disrespect

349
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,681
toward its employees?

350
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,521
Absolutely not.

351
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,577
Yes! Way to go!
See that?

352
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,162
Yeah. The floppy-haired
girl you date won a point.

353
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,956
Nineteen
serving four.

354
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,840
Nice, baby!
Nice one!

355
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:56,467
Hey, hey, you, you
I don't like your boyfriend

356
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:58,719
"Cause, 'cause, 'cause, "cause
'Cause he sucks at Ping-Pong

357
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,430
You know what? I'm sick
of this. Let's go. You and me!

358
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:04,225
What? Let's go!
Pick up a paddle.

359
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,436
Okay. Bring it on.
I am.

360
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,645
You think you
can handle this?

361
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,855
In my sleep.

362
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,773
Okay, volley
for serve. "P."

363
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,149
"O."

364
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,112
"P."

365
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,363
"O."

366
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,949
Do you want to go play
on the table upstairs?

367
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,034
- "P."
- "O."

368
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,368
Yes.

369
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,455
"P."

370
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:34,714
Michael,
I am very sorry.

371
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,674
Oh, hey,
no biggie. Just...

372
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,343
No, no, no.
This was rough.

373
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:41,804
We never meant for you to
get caught in the middle of this.

374
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,556
I'm very sorry.

375
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,484
Hey, David?

376
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,776
Yeah?

377
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,153
I think you're
a nice guy, too.

378
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,030
Thanks, Michael.

379
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,448
Why did I do it?

380
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,617
I don't know.

381
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,122
Jan said that it was
because of the photo

382
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:08,706
that she revealed the diary.

383
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,627
But she already brought the
diary with her to New York. So...

384
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,672
You expect to get screwed
by your company,

385
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:19,759
but you never expect to get
screwed by your girlfriend.

386
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,434
What do you want
to do for dinner?

387
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,187
How about Chinese?

388
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,731
We should really try
to save some money.

389
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,858
How about
something cheap?

390
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:41,026
That was my cheap suggestion.
Chinese was my cheap suggestion.

391
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,908
Can you do fast food?
Fine.

392
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,618
Fast food's fine.
