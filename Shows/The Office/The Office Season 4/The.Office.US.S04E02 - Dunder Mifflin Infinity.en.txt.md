# Episode 4x02 "Dunder Mifflin Infinity"

**Trivia**
- At one point Dwight says he has a grandfather "still puttering around in Argentina" and Dwight's attempt to visit him was protested by the Shoah Foundation, which is an organization dedicated to furthering the remembrance of the Holocaust. It is often implied that Dwight's German relatives were Nazis. Upon the ending of World War II, many Nazis fled to Argentina. Dwight's grandfather living in Argentina could mean he was a high-ranking Nazi officer. Josef Mengele, Adolf Eichmann and other high-ranking Nazis fled to Argentina.

- In a deleted scene from the previous episode, Fun Run (2007), Michael says that he makes his own salad dressing by mixing together Newman's Own Ranch and Italian salad dressings. In this episode, you can see a jar of it (named Great Scott with Michael's face on the label) on his desk when he's having lunch with Jan.

- Amy (Janine Poreba) who is shown as Toby's (Paul Lieberstein's) girlfriend, and whom he kisses way too long to taunt Jim and Pam, is his wife in real life.

- The dry erase calendar on the wall next to Angela's desk has clearly not been updated since season 3. It refers to both Karen and Ryan being employees at Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

- When threatened by Ryan's ageism, Creed dyes his hair black. Later in the conference room, Michael is asked why he re-used some pictures for his presentation and he says the printer was out of ink. The camera immediately zooms in on Creed looking slightly guilty, implying Creed used black printer ink to dye his hair.
