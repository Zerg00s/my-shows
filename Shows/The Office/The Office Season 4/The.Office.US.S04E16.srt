1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:06,213
Everybody, everybody, listen
up. I need your ideas now.

2
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,674
Ideas, please, right
now. Go, go! Come on!

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,384
Michael, we don't know
what you're talking about.

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,344
Wet cement outside.
It's drying fast.

5
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:16,056
Come on, this is a lifelong dream.
What do I write? What do I write?

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,766
Michael, you could
put your initials in it.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,393
M.G.S. No.

8
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,977
Some idiot named Mark Greg Schputnick
will claim credit for it. I don't...

9
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,484
That is true. Once in a
lifetime opportunity, people.

10
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,609
- Come on!
- Well...

11
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,611
Here we go! Yes?

12
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:30,946
When I was
a little girl...

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,823
Okay.

14
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,242
Okay, do it! Come on,
great! Let's hear it!

15
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,827
We found some wet cement...

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,954
It's drying, it's drying. ...in
the park in our neighborhood...

17
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,080
All right,
come on!

18
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,665
Come on, Phyllis!
What did we write?

19
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,292
Oh! Come on!

20
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,378
No! Here it is.
You draw a picture.

21
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:47,004
"Cause that says so
much more than words.

22
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,089
No, no!

23
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:49,173
Come on, give me
something good!

24
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,341
Okay, I was
watching E!

25
00:00:50,424 --> 00:00:52,676
And I saw Will Smith
outside the Chinese Theater,

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,844
and, oh, my God,
he looked so good.

27
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,095
Pam, translate.

28
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:57,848
She's talking about the handprints
that celebrities make in the cement.

29
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,974
I love it!

30
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:00,642
If you were a real star,
you'd put your face in it.

31
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:01,727
I love it more!

32
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,895
Michael, that
doesn't seem safe...

33
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,189
I love it!

34
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:07,858
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on!

35
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:15,324
We are here today not to
immortalize a man, but an idea.

36
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:17,951
Maybe the idea
of a man.

37
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:19,244
Hurry, please.

38
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,246
Greatness is only skin
deep, some people say.

39
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,748
Can you breathe?
Well, that's not true.

40
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:23,874
Other people believe
it's deep down inside.

41
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,042
Hold your breath.

42
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,210
And in this case,
that's also not true.

43
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,379
Ready? And...

44
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:29,504
Go!

45
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,048
Force it in as
deep as you can.

46
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,883
That's what she said.

47
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,679
Today's a very special
day for me. And it's really not about me.

48
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:40,223
It's about my grandkids.
It's about my great-grandkids.

49
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,602
I can come back here
when I'm 100,

50
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:47,189
and I can find that
piece of cement and say,

51
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,026
"That's me. Look, kids.
Your daddy left that face hole.”

52
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:54,696
I don't know.
It's a good feeling.

53
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,219
Okay.

54
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:18,887
Adjective.

55
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,100
"Tall."
No, no, "Nice."

56
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,770
Good one. Okay.
You ready?

57
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:27,855
Mmm-hmm.

58
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:32,526
"The tall man entered
the nice building,

59
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,488
"to visit a
very nice man.

60
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,990
"'Sit down, Mr. Smith. Can I
interest you in any good cat food?""

61
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,041
It's a man eating cat food!

62
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:48,917
What about
a cat eating man food?

63
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,046
Andy and Angela
seem very happy.

64
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,965
I hope nothing horrible
ever happens to them.

65
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,892
Yeah, I slept over at
a friend's house, and...

66
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:10,272
I forgot my contact solution, so I
had to wear my back-up glasses.

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,693
Shut up.

68
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,944
All right,
everybody.

69
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,240
Oh, my God. Pam, those
make you look so ugly.

70
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,494
Pam, in order to get
hotter, you take glasses off.

71
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:25,537
You're moving in
the wrong direction.

72
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,289
I don't have my contacts...

73
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,249
I can't even hear you.

74
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,002
It's just noise coming
out of an ugly scientist.

75
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,631
Everybody, we're gonna have
a little brainstorming session

76
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,091
in the conference room.

77
00:03:37,174 --> 00:03:38,800
Energize.

78
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,803
You know what
would energize me?

79
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,140
If you,
Pamela Morgan Beesly...

80
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,266
Don't you,
don't you...

81
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,643
If you propose to me during a
Michael meeting, I will say no.

82
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,230
Well, it's too late,
because I'm proposing

83
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:54,482
that you get me a cup of coffee,
which would energize me greatly

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,277
and make me the
happiest man in the world.

85
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,860
Everybody, so how are we
going to energize our office?

86
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,575
I mean, I haven't done
anything since Christmas.

87
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,079
Pam clearly has
just given up trying.

88
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,373
So what we need to do is
we need to get things going.

89
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,711
We need to get percolating a little bit.
Anybody have any ideas what we could do?

90
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,587
Any suggestions?
Yes, Andy?

91
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:19,633
What if we changed our outgoing
answering machine message

92
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:23,554
so it just had a little more
zing and a little more pep?

93
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:26,973
Zing and pep. Those are the kind
of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim.

94
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,934
What about if we did an
even newer voicemail message

95
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,937
that had even
more zing and pep?

96
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,940
Now we're cooking, I like
this. Maybe a whole theme.

97
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,109
Like a rap... A rap rhyme.
An urban thing.

98
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,487
An urban... Yeah, Stanley,
you want to help us out with that?

99
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,697
Stanley!
Earth to Stanley.

100
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
Not me.

101
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,784
Yes, you. Come on, Stanley,
put your little game down

102
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,035
and join the group.

103
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,161
No.

104
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,412
Stanley, we're having...

105
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,581
Leave me alone, damn it.

106
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:52,332
We're having
a brainstorm session.

107
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,959
Did I stutter?

108
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:04,010
Good. This is good. I'm
going to grab a glass of water.

109
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,768
Can I talk to you a second?

110
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,228
What?

111
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:19,109
I really think that you need to address
what happened with Stanley this morning.

112
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,446
What are you blabbering
about? Nothing happened.

113
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,449
Well, you know, Stanley
was openly insubordinate.

114
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,784
That, in the conference room?

115
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,076
Yeah.

116
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,745
We were joshing
around, the two of us.

117
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,706
And he said,
"Did I stutter?"

118
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,959
And
I said, "What, dawg?"

119
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:39,212
It was joking,
Toby, all right?

120
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,505
He didn't seem
like he was joking.

121
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,341
Well, you don't get it,
because Stanley is a beautiful,

122
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,802
sassy, powerful black man,

123
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,971
and you're you.

124
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,640
If you had any friends,
you would understand.

125
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:54,477
Friends joke with one another.
"Hey, you're poor."

126
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,816
"Well, hey, your mama's dead."
That's what friends do.

127
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,109
It's... You're so white.

128
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,738
All right. Well...

129
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,242
If you really believe
that Stanley was joking...

130
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,326
Mmm-hmm.

131
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,911
Why don't we
go ask him now?

132
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,913
Okay, I will.

133
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,873
I'm not feeling very
well right now, though.

134
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,335
My stomach hurts, so I may
be going home early today.

135
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:21,838
You know, Michael, sometimes
my daughter's stomach hurts

136
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:23,340
when there's
a mean girl at school.

137
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,924
Well, sometimes my stomach
hurts when you come into my office.

138
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:30,513
So it's probably
psychological.

139
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:37,437
You meet a lot of ladies driving an
Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight

140
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:42,021
and look over, and there's an Xterra next
to you, they're always driven by chicks.

141
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,652
So there's your icebreaker.

142
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,530
Scratch!

143
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,115
That's
a racing stripe.

144
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,741
Bumper's sagging.

145
00:06:49,825 --> 00:06:51,535
Hmm. I doubt
that very much.

146
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,747
This car is crap. I will
buy it for next to nothing.

147
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,872
How next to?

148
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,040
Well, here are
your options.

149
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:00,293
You can sell it for parts,
drive it off a cliff,

150
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,503
you can donate it to a person that
you'd like to see die in a car crash, or

151
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:09,011
you can sell it to me and I'll use
it as I would a wagon on my farm.

152
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,346
It will be towed
by a donkey.

153
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,265
I have to pick
one of those? Yes.

154
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,433
Can you go over
those options again?

155
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,642
You know what?

156
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,938
You knock $1,500 off the price right
now and I will take it off your hands.

157
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,314
It's gotta be now.

158
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,440
Well, I had the
Blue Book value...

159
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,775
Seal the deal.
Let's do it.

160
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,862
Let's do this thing.
Three, two, one.

161
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,364
Can I think about it?

162
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:29,823
Five, four, three,
two, now.

163
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,908
Let me think about it.

164
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,993
Now. Now.
Say it. Do it now.

165
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,078
Thinking about it.
Thinking.

166
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,203
Do it now! Do it.
Shake my hand.

167
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:37,539
You will sell me this car.
Shake my hand.

168
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,207
Yeah, all right!

169
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,172
What?

170
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:48,508
I see that you
gave me that form

171
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,344
that I asked you to give me,
Stanley the manly.

172
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:54,431
So thank you for that. I
guess we are back to normal.

173
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,308
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,892
Well, you know, the thing that
you said earlier that you didn't mean.

175
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,068
And that I forgive you for.
The whole thing's silly, isn't it?

176
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,571
Friends don't need to apologize
to friends, as far as I'm concerned.

177
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,739
So we are cool.

178
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,242
I am not going
to apologize to you.

179
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,702
It's like I used
to tell my wife.

180
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:20,286
"I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong,
and if you don't like it, you can leave."

181
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:25,082
And I say the same thing to my current
wife, and I'll say it to my next one, too.

182
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,340
Jim is in charge of Stanley
only in sales-related matters.

183
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,843
Hence the green line.
Green for money.

184
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:33,678
Sales, get it? There
is this yellow zigzag

185
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:36,264
that does give Ryan the
authority to discipline Stanley.

186
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,349
Great.

187
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,600
However,
in so doing,

188
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:42,604
it zigs past your name, hence zagging
you and making you appear weak.

189
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,940
Thus the yellow color.
Yellow for cowardly.

190
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,359
What's the pink?

191
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,527
Menstrual cycles.

192
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay.

193
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:55,154
Is there anybody up here,
anybody at all, that can deal with this

194
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,827
other than me...
You.

195
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,494
Well, there is the emergency
disaster mode for the org chart.

196
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:06,958
This gives me full authority over
every single person in the office.

197
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,298
I never said
you could do that.

198
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,840
All you have
to do is say it.

199
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,175
Okay, I'll think about it.

200
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,718
Say it. Just do it.

201
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:18,302
Don't think, say it. Do it.
Five, four, three, two...

202
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:22,560
Do it. Give me
control, Michael.

203
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:30,235
I promise to give authority
back to you when this crisis is over.

204
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,862
Do it, Michael.

205
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,656
Do it. Hey.

206
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,159
This office needs
a strongman.

207
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,370
Say it.

208
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,707
No.
So...

209
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,128
All right, well then, you're gonna
have to deal with this yourself.

210
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:58,471
Hey, Pam. I really
like your glasses.

211
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,056
Oh, thanks.

212
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,726
All the girlfriends that I've
ever had have worn glasses.

213
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,604
Oh, okay.

214
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,647
Yeah, it's kind of a
turn-on for me, actually.

215
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:08,732
I should probably
get back to...

216
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,817
Like librarians.

217
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,234
...entering the...

218
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,986
Could you just say,

219
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,780
"These are due
back Thursday"?

220
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:15,905
No.

221
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:32,714
Dunder Mifflin. This is
Pam. Okay, go ahead.

222
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,761
A lot of jazz cats are blind,

223
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,098
but they can play the piano
like nobody's business.

224
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,057
I'd like to put the piano in front of Pam
without her glasses and see what happens.

225
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,646
I'd also like to
see her topless.

226
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,486
Mike.

227
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,363
I'm very busy here, man.
Darryl...

228
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,991
Have you ever been in a gang?

229
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:01,159
Why?

230
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,912
It's an advice question, and

231
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,541
if you don't want to talk about
it, I completely understand. It's...

232
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,500
No, no, no. I know
it's very, very personal.

233
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,711
No...

234
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,714
I have.

235
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:16,090
I knew it. Okay.

236
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,926
Who are we
talking about here?

237
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,677
Crips, Bloods?
Both.

238
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:20,762
God.

239
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,056
Yeah, them
and the Latin Kings.

240
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,017
The Warriors, Newsies.
Okay.

241
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:28,061
Okay, so dig this.

242
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,608
You're on the street and
one of your gang disses you.

243
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,526
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah, right.

244
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,945
So what do you do to
get him to make it right?

245
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,529
Well, see, in the gang world, we
use something called "Fluffy fingers."

246
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,036
What is that?

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,705
That's where if somebody
really gets in your face,

248
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,291
you know, you just
start tickling them.

249
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:54,420
Really?
Yeah.

250
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:56,339
And he starts tickling you.

251
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:59,050
You know, pretty soon
you're laughing and hugging.

252
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:01,344
Before you know it, you've
forgotten the whole thing.

253
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:05,265
Y'all can just go to church
together and get an ice cream cone.

254
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,893
I would have
never thought that

255
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,979
gangs would be
tickling each other.

256
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,981
Well, it's effective.

257
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,287
I think it's self-explanatory.
Hey, Jim! Come here for a second.

258
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,790
Can you answer me something
as a true Eagles fan?

259
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,541
Oh, boy.

260
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,710
How do you live with
a franchise this bad?

261
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,462
On a wing
and a prayer, mostly.

262
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,338
All right,
whatever you say.

263
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,257
Listen, while I have
you here with Toby,

264
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,801
I need to give you a formal
warning about your job performance.

265
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,012
A formal warning?

266
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,932
It's actually not a joke. I know
how you spend your time here.

267
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:50,310
I know how little you
care about your job.

268
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,562
And honestly, if you spent
as much time selling

269
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,440
as you do goofing around with
Dwight and hanging out at reception,

270
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,276
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

271
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,946
I'm sorry, is this because I talked
to Wallace about your website?

272
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,115
Because I really didn't
mean to go over your head.

273
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,534
This has nothing to
do with that, all right?

274
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,871
I always appreciate constructive
criticism about my job performance.

275
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,456
I thrive on it.

276
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,917
I'm sorry, then do you mind
explaining it a little better?

277
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,127
"Cause I'm not
sure what's really...

278
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,045
Whoa. Don't get
all defensive, all right?

279
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,755
It's just a warning.

280
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,384
If you want the details, Toby can
provide them. You take it easy, all right?

281
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:26,012
I'd say all the goofing
around at Pam's desk

282
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:29,557
and hanging out with Pam
has finally caught up to him.

283
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,268
You know, with Pam.

284
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,941
Hey, what happened?
What did Ryan want?

285
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,444
Oh, we were just

286
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,112
talking about
bureaucratic stuff.

287
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:44,697
Because you're
very important.

288
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:45,823
Yeah.

289
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,336
Oh, what's Dwight up to?
Oh, probably nothing.

290
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,927
What the hell
is this all about?

291
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,263
You're flipping
my car for profit.

292
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,891
It's my car now.

293
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:15,474
I gave you a deal
based on what you said to me.

294
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,941
Yeah, well, seller beware.
Now if you'll excuse me,

295
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,987
I've got to monitor a three-way
bidding war for my car on eBay.

296
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,741
I've got a Mad Lib for you.

297
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:31,786
"A stupid, idiotic numbskull

298
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,874
"named Andy Bernard
sold his Xterra

299
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:39,961
"to a smart and capable
man named Dwight.

300
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,631
"This is shaping up to be
an awesome day for Dwight."

301
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,978
Okay, everybody. Shh. Listen up.
Earlier today, Stanley sassed me,

302
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,487
and Toby gave me some
suggestions on how to discipline him.

303
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,364
They did not work, obviously,
because they were stupid.

304
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:12,160
So I am now going
to fake fire him.

305
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:13,995
What does that mean?

306
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,081
It's like a mock execution.

307
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,166
That's not a good idea.
Yes, it is a good idea.

308
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,377
It's the only possible
solution I have left.

309
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,794
Well, you can
actually fire him.

310
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:22,962
No...

311
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,048
I've had enough of you.

312
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,383
Why are you telling us this?

313
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:30,219
Because I want you to behave as if
I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?

314
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,763
Michael, if you
hadn't told us this,

315
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,475
then we would've thought
that you were actually firing him.

316
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:40,059
I'm not firing him! I will need
you to act like I am firing him.

317
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,525
Just... What I'm going to do is I'm
going to pretend that I'm firing him.

318
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,862
And I need you to act like I
am firing him. Do you get that?

319
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,739
Do you get it? I'm
teaching him a lesson.

320
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,701
He needs to learn humility,
all right? That's all I'm...

321
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,662
Okay, here he comes.
Let's just play-act.

322
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,791
Stanley, may I talk
to you for a second?

323
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,426
Stanley Hudson,
you are fired.

324
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,144
Are you serious?

325
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,230
I am serious.
We are all serious.

326
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,317
You are fired
like a heart attack.

327
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,778
You're firing me
over three words?

328
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,905
Yes.
Have you lost your mind?

329
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:34,242
Do you think I'm
gonna let you do this to me?

330
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,162
I've watched you screw
up this office for 10 years,

331
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,373
and I'm filing a lawsuit, and I'm
gonna tell them about every stupid thing

332
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,791
you've ever done
up in this office.

333
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,042
All right, okay.

334
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,795
You know what?
Now you know how I feel.

335
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:48,506
This was a fake firing.

336
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,177
Lesson learned. Good
work, everybody. Very nice.

337
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:54,553
So I'm not fired.

338
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,765
That's it.

339
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,975
And...

340
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,477
Do you have anything
to say to me?

341
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,645
Ooh, yes, I do.

342
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,025
You are out of your damn
little pea-sized mind.

343
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,608
What is wrong with you?
Do you have any sense at all?

344
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,407
Do you have any idea
how to run an office?

345
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,827
Every day you do something
stupider than you did the day before.

346
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,205
And I think, "There's no
possible way he can top that."

347
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,500
But what do you do? You
find a way, damn it, to top it.

348
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,002
You are a
professional idiot...

349
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,754
Hey, stop it!

350
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,548
Okay, everybody out.

351
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,467
Who? Yeah,
everybody except Stanley.

352
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:41,976
Let's go.

353
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,728
I can't find my glasses.
Okay, you know what?

354
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,023
Why don't you take my hand and
leave them, and let's get out of here.

355
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,525
Okay, okay.

356
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:56,741
It's Michael versus Stanley,
and it is the clash of the titans.

357
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,787
In one corner, you have
Michael, and he is mad.

358
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,707
And then in the other corner,
you have Stanley, and he's mad.

359
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,793
So that's about it.

360
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,025
I don't understand why
you keep picking on me.

361
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,109
Oh, for the love of God.

362
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,443
You just

363
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:37,027
do, and I don't know why,
so please help me understand.

364
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,657
Fine. Here it is. You are
a person I do not respect.

365
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:46,081
The things you say, your
actions, your methods and style,

366
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,752
everything you would do, I
would do it the opposite way.

367
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,258
Well, Stanley,

368
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,011
maybe you are feeling
that you don't respect me

369
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,221
because you don't
know me very well.

370
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,099
Michael, I've known
you a very long time,

371
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:07,395
and the more I've gotten to know
you, the less I've come to respect you.

372
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,023
Any other theories?

373
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,656
All right, you
don't respect me.

374
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,283
I accept that.

375
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:24,411
But listen to me.

376
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,996
You can't talk to me that way in this
office, you just can't. I am your boss.

377
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,628
Can't allow it.

378
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,589
Fair enough.

379
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,971
I am a good person, and sometimes
good people don't get no respect.

380
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,770
Rodney Dangerfield.

381
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,858
"Hey, I
don't get no respect. No respect at all.

382
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,112
"When I was in the sandbox
as a kid, I got no respect.

383
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,866
"My wife likes
to talk after sex.

384
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,912
"So she called me from a hotel
room, said, 'I don't respect you.'

385
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,789
"Thoughtless.

386
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,420
"You know what don't get
no respect? Airplane food.

387
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,800
"Why don't they just make
the plane out of the airline food?

388
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:26,178
"My wife don't get no respect.
So... Take her, please, for example.

389
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:32,229
"If you don't get no respect,
you might be a redneck."

390
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,360
"Respect is nice."
Borat.

391
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:44,993
"What's the deal with
Grape-Nuts? No grapes, no nuts.

392
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,329
"I don't get no respect.”

393
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,586
So I'm thinking as a
reward for our loyal clients

394
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:58,589
that we contact their assistants
and we find out where they live,

395
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:03,465
and then, we go to their houses in
the middle of summer and go caroling.

396
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:08,845
It is a summer Christmas sale-e-bration,
and we'll call it, "A summer sales-a-lot."

397
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,563
Feedback, anybody?
Stanley?

398
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,692
Has potential to be
your best idea yet.

399
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:21,987
That's the dumbest
thing I ever heard.

400
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,698
Damn it, Phyllis.

401
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,075
All right, everybody
out except Phyllis.
