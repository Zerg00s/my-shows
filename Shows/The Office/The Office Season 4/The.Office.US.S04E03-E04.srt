1
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,212
Hey.

2
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:06,255
I got you one.
Oh, wow. Thank you.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,465
Yeah. I'm just going
to grab some chips.

4
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:09,258
You want some?
No, thanks.

5
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,968
We're still having
lunch today, right?

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,470
I guess.

7
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,975
How dare you.

8
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,617
Hey, Toby, what's this?

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,702
"I just want to remind everyone
about the company rules

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,414
"involving PDA, or public
displays of affection"?

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,125
Yes. Some people in the
office have complained...

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,752
Oh, really?
...about some other people

13
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,336
engaging in PDA,

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,965
and, you know, I just want to remind
that it's not appropriate to do that.

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,925
Is this about me and Jan
in my office?

16
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,219
Because I will have you
know that that was consensual.

17
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:57,556
What we did has nothing to
do with you or anyone here.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,267
I don't think anyone
heard anything.

19
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,480
We were very discreet and
most people had left by that point.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,524
Okay... So I don't think
it's any of your business.

21
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:10,110
What I think you should do
is roll up the memo real tight...

22
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:12,362
Okay, hey, look, the
memo was not about you.

23
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:16,324
For the record, I have never been involved
with anyone at work in any capacity.

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,619
All right, everyone.
Look. It...

25
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:21,288
All right, the complaint
was about Jim and Pam.

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,416
So...

27
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,835
No way.
What?

28
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:27,794
You guys are together?

29
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:30,005
Um...

30
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,800
Yep.

31
00:01:32,883 --> 00:01:35,802
Yes, we are.
Wow!

32
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:37,679
Tuna!
Awesome!

33
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,055
- I knew it.
- You guys!

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,392
- To the two of you.
- Yes! Yes!

35
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,603
Toby, was this your fun
little way of congratulating us?

36
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,981
Yes.

37
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:49,483
Okay, mind is exploding.

38
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,610
Get over here. Come on.

39
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,238
Come here. Okay.

40
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,073
Okay, stand up.

41
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,408
Okay, here we go.

42
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,623
Everyone, this is a day
that will live in infamy,

43
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:09,624
because today is the day
that Jim and Pam become one.

44
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,881
Actually we've been dating
for a couple of months.

45
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:15,926
I love you guys so much.

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,226
Phone's ringing. No, no,
no, Pam, let them ring.

47
00:02:24,518 --> 00:02:28,730
Let the bells of Dunder
Mifflin chime out your love,

48
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,569
because this is really good.
This is really good.

49
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:38,903
My heart soars
with the eagle's nest.

50
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,911
I don't see it. I think
they both could do better.

51
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:47,708
It's not a surprise to me.
Pam is the office mattress.

52
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,334
Jim Halpert's
off the market.

53
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:53,046
Guess who just became the
best-looking single guy in the office?

54
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:30,083
Hey, can you make
that straighter?

55
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,794
That's what she said.

56
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,755
Did you plan that?

57
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,006
No.

58
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,717
"Can you make
that straighter?

59
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,636
"That job looks hard.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,972
"You should put
your mouth on that."

61
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:45,432
How can you even use
that one naturally?

62
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,351
Blowing up balloons,
I thought.

63
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,645
"You might want
to trim it a little." Michael...

64
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,897
Oh, is Ryan coming
back today?

65
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,232
Yeah, he is.

66
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,985
Oh.

67
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:00,030
Pam and Jim are together.
Ryan is visiting.

68
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,909
Only thing that could make
this day better IS ice cream.

69
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,830
What do you want?

70
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,373
To give you this.

71
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:13,126
What is that?

72
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,669
It's a feral barn cat.

73
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,630
I trapped him last night
and I'm giving him to you

74
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,799
as a replacement cat
for the one I destroyed.

75
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,676
Her name was Sprinkles.

76
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,096
And his name is Garbage.

77
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,141
Mose calls him Garbage,
'cause he likes to eat garbage.

78
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:28,308
Don't you, Garbage?

79
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:32,312
I can't believe you just thought
you could replace Sprinkles.

80
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,356
Before she's even
in the ground.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,983
You haven't buried her yet?

82
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,859
Don't rush me.
I'm grieving.

83
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:41,363
Garbage can be very helpful,
okay? He's a useful cat.

84
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,158
He killed an entire family
of raccoons. Look at him.

85
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:47,452
I don't want Garbage.
I want Sprinkles.

86
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,968
Hey, Toby.

87
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,596
Hey, you two.

88
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:06,680
Hey.

89
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,099
So, now that
we are dating,

90
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,643
we just wanted to know if
we had to sigh one of those

91
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:14,020
"we're dating" things
for the company.

92
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,980
Oh, well, you know those are
only for, you know, "relationships."

93
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:23,238
So if this is just a casual
thing, there's no need.

94
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,865
Really.
Oh.

95
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,744
Well, I won't speak for Jim,
but it's, like, pretty official.

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,456
Uh-huh.

97
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,919
Sorry, so do we need
to sign one or...

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,714
Let's just wait and
see what happens. Yeah.

99
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,383
What?
Let's just wait.

100
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:45,927
Oh, okay.
Okay.

101
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,137
Great.

102
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,647
Hey, Ryan, welcome back...
Hold on one second.

103
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,283
Hey, Pam, it's great to
see you. Is Michael in?

104
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,619
Yeah. MICHAEL: Hey.
There he is. There he is.

105
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,663
He's back
and he's with a beard.

106
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:15,457
He has facial hair.

107
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,127
Look at him. All grown
up and no place to go.

108
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,547
Hello, Mr. Sonny Crockett.
I'm Tubbs.

109
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,508
Okay. Should we get started?

110
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,802
Oh, yeah,
let's get started because...

111
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,637
Yes, 'cause this is
very serious business.

112
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,055
Yeah. Exactly.

113
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,598
This is a business
meeting. Business meeting.

114
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,933
Fire guy.
Stop that!

115
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,184
That's right.

116
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,811
That's right. Fire
guy. - Oh, you scared me.

117
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,979
He's the fire guy.
Don't start any fires.

118
00:06:37,062 --> 00:06:38,521
Fire guy.

119
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,690
You weren't here for that.

120
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:41,357
Here for what?
When he started the fire.

121
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,942
Look how big he is. Look at
you. You are so mature and old

122
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:49,407
and little man now.
You're like our little man.

123
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,658
Okay...
Little old man-boy.

124
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,202
Michael, everybody...
With a beard.

125
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,620
- Bearded man-boy.
- Wow!

126
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,123
Let me say something. I
know I used to be a temp here,

127
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,707
but now everything
is different.

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,335
I'd like your respect.
I am your boss now.

129
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,462
You're gonna have to treat me
the same way you treated Jan.

130
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,630
Oh, wow.

131
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,133
Mmm. That's a little kinky.
I don't swing that way.

132
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:07,967
Okay.
Woo!

133
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,344
I think Ryan has
a gay crush on me.

134
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,140
Enough! Okay? This is
inappropriate and it stops right now.

135
00:07:16,518 --> 00:07:17,936
Do you understand?

136
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,354
Yes.

137
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,440
Everybody, come on,
settle down.

138
00:07:21,523 --> 00:07:23,149
Let's get serious here.

139
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:26,903
Ryan has a very special
important presentation to do,

140
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:29,531
which we will be doing in the
conference room in 10 minutes.

141
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,618
Perfect. Sound
good? Okay. All right.

142
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,035
Yeah, Ryan snapped at me.

143
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:38,123
But there was this twinkle in his
eye that I picked up on, which said,

144
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,668
"Dude, we're friends. I'm
doing this for appearances.

145
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,462
"I am the big boss now,

146
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:46,631
"and I have to seem like
an ogre, but you know me

147
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:49,968
"and you trust me
and we like each other,

148
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,552
"and we'll always be friends and I
would never take you for granted

149
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,810
"in a million years.

150
00:07:57,893 --> 00:08:01,438
"And I miss you, man,
and I love you."

151
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,690
His words.

152
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,741
Dunder Mifflin Infinity represents
a floor-to-ceiling streamlining

153
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,076
of our business model.

154
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,994
The centerpiece
of the campaign

155
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,997
IS a new business-to-business
website interface

156
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,626
that will allow us to compete
directly with big-box chains.

157
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,294
Wait a second,

158
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,089
last time I checked, Dunder
Mifflin already has a website.

159
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:30,175
And quite frankly, I'm not
really sure what's wrong with it.

160
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:33,011
This is a
massive overhaul.

161
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,971
We're getting
younger, sleeker

162
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:38,183
and more agile with the way
that we adapt to the marketplace.

163
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,852
All essential personnel will be
issued BlackBerries for company use.

164
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,312
Oh, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme.

165
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,773
I'll stick around for a while to
help you set them up afterwards.

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,526
Any questions? Dwight?

167
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:51,154
What if we don't want to use a BlackBerry
because they are stupid and pointless?

168
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,489
This is company-wide, Dwight.

169
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,574
Got it.

170
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:54,824
Andy?

171
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:57,744
You should call it
Dunder Mifflinfinity.

172
00:08:57,911 --> 00:08:59,829
You know,
push the words together.

173
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:01,414
Any other questions?

174
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,959
Kelly Kapour?

175
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,628
Can we speak privately
about our relationship?

176
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,796
Thank you, everybody.

177
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,464
Ryan Howard, everybody.

178
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,840
Good job.

179
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,136
That was some fun stuff.

180
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:16,387
When does the website
go up? As fast as possible.

181
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,182
We want to start
retraining people ASAP

182
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:20,100
so we can hit the ground
running with the new system.

183
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,560
Cool beans.

184
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,521
We're screwed.
Who is?

185
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,648
Us. You and me.
The old-timers.

186
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,900
I am not old. You are old.

187
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,735
You are, like, 100.

188
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,613
You're over 40.
That's the cut-off.

189
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:34,823
Are you listening to
what he's saying?

190
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,826
"Retraining," "new
system, youth."

191
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,788
I'm telling you this kid is the
Grim Reaper. You deal with this

192
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:46,293
or you, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the
chick you hit with the car, we're goners.

193
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,006
I swore I wouldn't tell
anybody this, but

194
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:55,468
in the interest of
revealing secrets...

195
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:58,555
Oh, my God, this is gonna
make your brain explode.

196
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,767
Dwight and Angela

197
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,309
dating.

198
00:10:03,393 --> 00:10:05,186
Have been for six months.

199
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,480
Swear to God.

200
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,149
Oh, this is great. I was actually
gonna wait and tell you on your birthday,

201
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,652
but this is much more fun.

202
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:15,989
No, they have been dating
for, like, two years.

203
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,200
Since before your barbecue.

204
00:10:19,743 --> 00:10:21,619
Wait, what?

205
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:23,997
You knew?

206
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,332
And you didn't
say anything?

207
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,542
You didn't say
anything to me.

208
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,003
Fair enough.

209
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,383
Wow. We should have started
dating, like, a long time ago.

210
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,508
Oh, sorry...
Can you believe that?

211
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:36,884
I didn't know you guys
were in here.

212
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,136
Oh, no.
We're just sitting here.

213
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,222
I couldn't see your hands.

214
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,810
Hey, Pam, by the way,
it's great that you're dating.

215
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:49,393
But when a new client calls, you just have
to randomly assign them to a salesperson.

216
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:54,152
You can't base who gets new clients
on who you're sleeping with that week.

217
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,029
Okay?
Okay.

218
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,365
Okay- Okay-

219
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:02,034
And that is why we waited
so long to tell people.

220
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,506
Okay, what's up?

221
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,383
Yeah, okay,
I was just...

222
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,637
After the presentation I just wanted to
make sure that vis-a-vis me in the office,

223
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,305
everything is
business as usual?

224
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,808
Well, it is business,
but not as usual.

225
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,476
Yeah, no, I understand.

226
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,060
We're making great strides, we're
updating, but business as usual, no?

227
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,859
No. We're throwing out the entire
playbook, we're starting from scratch,

228
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:37,070
we're implementing
a brand new system.

229
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,989
Good. So we're
on the same page.

230
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,240
No, we're not.

231
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,702
Michael, I know exactly how much time
and manpower are wasted in this branch.

232
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,170
This company is getting
younger, faster and more efficient.

233
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,421
You need to
prepare yourself.

234
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,217
We had a foreign exchange
student live with us when I was young

235
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,471
and we called him my brother
and that's what I thought he was.

236
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:09,603
And then he went home to
what is now formerly Yugoslavia,

237
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,273
taking all of my
blue jeans with him.

238
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,360
And I had to spend
the entire winter in shorts.

239
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,280
That is what Ryan is like.

240
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,574
A fake brother
who steals your jeans.

241
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:29,705
So, how are you?

242
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,250
Awesome. I am dating
a lot of guys.

243
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,794
Good. A lot. Black guys, mostly.

244
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,504
- Kelly.
- What?

245
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,509
Wait...

246
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,929
How do you touch just one
of these buttons at a time?

247
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:45,388
I don't know.

248
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,307
Did you even try?

249
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,978
If the kid wants to
set mine up, I'll let him.

250
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,687
I can't see half the things.

251
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,398
It's too little.
Use the phone.

252
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:59,194
I want you to tell me that
you care about me. That is what I want.

253
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,113
Kelly, I'm your
boss now, okay?

254
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,281
You can't keep talking to
me like I'm your boyfriend.

255
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:06,618
Oh, big strong man,
fancy new whatever.

256
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,953
I don't think you
ever cared about me.

257
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:09,120
I never cared about you?

258
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:11,164
Six months ago, Karen
Filippelli sent me an email,

259
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,666
asked me out,
I said no,

260
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:14,375
because I was committed
to our relationship.

261
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,336
Well, I hope you're still
committed, because I'm pregnant.

262
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,134
And guess what, buddy?
I am keeping it.

263
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,594
Okay. Okay.

264
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,137
Do you feel prepared
to help me raise a baby?

265
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:29,390
I can't... I can't talk
about this right now, okay?

266
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,351
After work,
we'll go out to dinner.

267
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,228
We'll talk about it
then, okay?

268
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,567
We have a date.

269
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,031
Hello.
Hello, Dwight.

270
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,700
I've been thinking
about things

271
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,164
and I wanted to know if you
would have dinner with me tonight.

272
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,332
Really?

273
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,583
Yes.

274
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,128
I'll make a reservation.
No, no. Let me cook for you.

275
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:01,964
Cauliflower and noodles.
Baked potato on the side.

276
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,342
I would prefer a public place.

277
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,928
See you after work.

278
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,977
Hi, Pam.

279
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,563
Is Michael in?
In his office.

280
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:18,189
You can go right in.
Okay.

281
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,315
Jan.

282
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,235
Ryan. Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

283
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:26,114
So, elephant in the room,
I have your old job.

284
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,743
Well, not exactly my job. I
mean, I had a different title.

285
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:34,038
Oh, well, excuse me. Same
office, same responsibilities.

286
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:37,041
Different salary. You'll
get there. Don't worry.

287
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,669
Well, you look great.

288
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,379
Thank you. Thank you.

289
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,381
Scranton suits you.

290
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,216
Best decision I ever made.

291
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,469
You were let go.

292
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,096
You know, I love the beard.
Keep it forever.

293
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,932
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:58,146
What is the actual deal with
these things in terms of testicles?

295
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,397
What?

296
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,234
I don't want to grow weird sperm
in case we ever want to have kids.

297
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,821
So what's Ryan doing here?

298
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:09,282
Oh, I don't know.

299
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,534
They're launching a
big new business plan,

300
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,411
new website...
Blah, blah, blah.

301
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:17,081
He's being a real twerp
about it, too.

302
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:21,665
It's all about youth and
agility and streamlining

303
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,005
and trying to squeeze out
the older people.

304
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,091
He's such a snake.
Well...

305
00:15:26,174 --> 00:15:28,551
I hope he gets hit
with an ageism suit.

306
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,012
What is that word?

307
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,639
Ageism?

308
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,935
Companies, they can't discriminate
against people due to old age.

309
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,979
Like a couple of years ago, we tried to
force out some of the older branch managers

310
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,606
with a mandatory
retirement age.

311
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,400
And then Ed Truck,
your old boss,

312
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,528
threatened us with a
lawsuit, so we had to back off.

313
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,989
So older people have just as
many rights as younger people?

314
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,741
Yes, Michael.

315
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:53,993
They do.

316
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,768
Creed?
Yes, sir.

317
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:21,729
Everything okay?
Everything's cool, dude.

318
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,024
I'm 30. Well,
in November, I'll be 30.

319
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,320
Is there another
meeting scheduled?

320
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,155
I was gonna do the
BlackBerry tutorial in here.

321
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:34,325
Michael told us to wait in
here. We don't know why.

322
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:38,829
Oh, man.

323
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,540
Good. We're all here.

324
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,334
We can get started.
Michael.

325
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,918
Have a seat.
We're not doing this today.

326
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,503
Have a seat like
everybody else.

327
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,130
Okay. This is...

328
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,798
It's still my office,
Ryan.

329
00:16:55,722 --> 00:17:00,222
Well, there has been a lot
of talk about new ideas today.

330
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,855
Well, new ideas are fine,

331
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,608
but they are also illegal

332
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:09,318
because they are
a form of ageism.

333
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,695
What? Yes. I am right.

334
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:17,281
Did you know that, "The age
discrimination in employment act of 1967

335
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:22,331
"prohibits employment discrimination
based on age with respect to employees

336
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,375
"40 years of age or older"?

337
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,626
I did.

338
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,378
Mmm. Technically, he's right.

339
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:28,504
Hey, shut up, Toby.

340
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:33,088
Look, why do we, as a society,
hate old people so much?

341
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,552
Because they're lame.

342
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,472
No! Creed, no, they are not.

343
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:42,018
In fact, many cultures
revere old people

344
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,562
because of their
storytelling ability.

345
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,439
Like the old lady
from Titanic.

346
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:51,023
Or the funny things that they
can do, like, "Where's the Beef?"

347
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:53,738
Yeah? Why do you have
the Big picture up again?

348
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,532
You used that already
when you burned your foot.

349
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,033
Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.

350
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,161
I was going to put up
some new pictures,

351
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,248
but all of the ink
in the printer was gone.

352
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,749
Oh.

353
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,669
Michael Scott?
That is me. Come on in.

354
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,213
Who is this old fart?

355
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:14,634
Did you just stagger off the
street out of a box or something?

356
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,636
Who's this worthless
bag of bones?

357
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,220
Well, this guy is none other than
one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin,

358
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,267
Mr. Robert Dunder.

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,812
Huh?
Oh, yeah.

360
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:27,980
Yes!

361
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,940
Hi, everyone. Michael, can
I talk to you for a second?

362
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,401
Sure thing.

363
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,444
Excuse me.

364
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,572
We have actual work to do.

365
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:37,990
Fine.

366
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,493
Then I will call David Wallace
and you can explain to him

367
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,871
why you threw the founder of the
company out on his ancient butt.

368
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,669
Bob, how old are you?

369
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:51,254
I'm 87.

370
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,798
87 years young.

371
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,426
And still active.
That is great.

372
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,845
Did you know that Bob is still a
member of the board of Dunder Mifflin?

373
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,724
Well, I haven't been
to a board meeting in years.

374
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,393
I send a proxy.

375
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,229
Ah! Still sends his own
proxy. Good for you.

376
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:11,190
I'm gonna live for
a very long time.

377
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,943
My Grandma Schrute
lived to be 101.

378
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,946
My Grandpa Manheim is 103,

379
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,574
and still puttering around
down in Argentina.

380
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,033
I tried to go visit him once,

381
00:19:21,117 --> 00:19:24,245
but my travel visa was protested
by the Shoah Foundation.

382
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:27,957
I started this
company in 1949.

383
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,042
Wow.

384
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,294
Back then it was an
industrial supplier

385
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,590
of metal brackets,
mostly, for construction.

386
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,966
Oh, boy.

387
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,384
And then Mifflin,

388
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,553
of course he killed
himself later,

389
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,473
uh, but I knew Mifflin
through the Rotary Club.

390
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:44,640
Great.

391
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:45,975
And he was...

392
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:50,104
He was at dinner with Beverly
and her husband...

393
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,898
What was his name?

394
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:54,984
Jerry. Jerry Trupianno...
I don't know.

395
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,322
...from South Jersey
and he was tall.

396
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,075
Both he and Mifflin
were tall guys.

397
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:05,286
Great. That's great.
Thank you for coming in.

398
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,996
Robert Dunder, everybody.

399
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,208
Thank you. That was wonderful.
Do you have a ride?

400
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,710
Well, I came here
in a cab. Perfect.

401
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,754
Could you get me that...
That's nice.

402
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,674
Inspirational.
What have we learned?

403
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:22,257
Well, we have learned that you
can't teach an old dog new tricks,

404
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:26,223
because it's illegal.
And you will go to jail.

405
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:27,933
I think that I should
help him get home.

406
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,686
No. No, don't help him.
He doesn't need help, Pam.

407
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,404
What a nice guy.

408
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,325
Good night, guys.

409
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,328
Well, today was a
fantastic waste of time.

410
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,414
I disagree. I think it
was very valuable.

411
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:52,958
Michael, technology helps business,
okay? You should not resist it.

412
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,418
This is the way
the world is moving.

413
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:57,379
I happen to think that the old
ways of doing business are better.

414
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,007
And I can prove it.

415
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,842
Okay. I look forward to
hearing your ideas.

416
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,345
Where do you want to go?

417
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,639
I don't know, some place
romantic and expensive.

418
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,141
Kelly, come on.

419
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:09,308
You know what,
you're right.

420
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:13,187
I'm feeling kind of nauseous,
anyway. So, you know, skip it.

421
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:21,654
Are you enjoying
your vegetarian noodles?

422
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,030
Very much.

423
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,116
How's your meat?

424
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,327
Dry. Delicious.

425
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,124
I heard a joke today.

426
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,876
Oh, that's funny.

427
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,378
Yes, it was.

428
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,718
Are you enjoying
your mineral water?

429
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,887
I can't do this.
I can't be with you.

430
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:52,264
Every time I look in your eyes I
see Sprinkles' stiff, lifeless body.

431
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:56,893
Then don't look in my eyes. Look
right here. It's an old sales trick.

432
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,485
I'm sorry. I gave this
everything I could.

433
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:02,903
No, please don't
do this, monkey.

434
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:06,156
I will leave your toothbrush on
top of your tire tomorrow morning.

435
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,333
Smell that.

436
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,750
Do you smell that?

437
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,877
Dry rot?

438
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,047
No, Dwight, that smells
like good business to me.

439
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,881
What I have done here
is I have collected

440
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,803
all the finest gourmet items
that Scranton has to offer.

441
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:28,679
Sweet, chocolate turtles.

442
00:22:28,763 --> 00:22:31,807
Yes. No, no, those
are for our clients.

443
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:34,018
Actually, our ex-clients.
I'll explain later.

444
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:38,602
Ryan wants everything in our
company to be about emails and IMs,

445
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:43,732
but I think he is forgetting about
the original instant message,

446
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,534
letters attached to
baskets of food.

447
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,626
Excuse me, Angela. Michael
asked me to turn in these receipts

448
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,712
for these gift
basket items.

449
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,797
Thank you.
You're welcome.

450
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,009
Is that all?
Yes.

451
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:11,763
I miss you.

452
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,432
Elevators.

453
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,685
Dwight, you have
to listen to me.

454
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:20,856
We are not seeing each other
anymore. Can you accept that?

455
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,610
Fine.

456
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,946
Then I just want to
be friends.

457
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,031
Good.

458
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:30,699
Plus a little extra.
Also, I love you.

459
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,663
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

460
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,748
You don't?
No.

461
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:38,541
You lied about being
pregnant. Right. So?

462
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,960
You really don't understand why
that might make me kind of angry?

463
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,254
We're never getting
back together. No.

464
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,589
Why not?

465
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:48,342
Hey.

466
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,011
Hey.

467
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,224
All right, I just have to
ask, now that we're public,

468
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:58,644
is the magic gone?

469
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,940
It's funny you bring that up
because, yes, it is.

470
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:08,362
I knew it. Oh, man.
Just like that, huh?

471
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:12,491
I think, I mean, I don't
know what it is, but...

472
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,787
Be honest.
I now find you repulsive.

473
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:18,289
That's honest.

474
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,375
All right. Fair enough.

475
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:26,964
It was really fun while it
lasted, though, wasn't it?

476
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,507
Yeah.

477
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:30,134
For me it was.

478
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,594
Okay.

479
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,929
All right.

480
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,851
Yeah.

481
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,228
Hey, boss, I didn't know
you were coming in today.

482
00:24:41,312 --> 00:24:43,063
What is going on here?

483
00:24:43,147 --> 00:24:44,314
I am glad that you asked.

484
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,234
Listen up, everybody.

485
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:50,817
In the last year, we have lost
seven clients to the big chains.

486
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,742
These gift baskets are our
ticket back into their lives.

487
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,160
We are going to show up

488
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,289
at these businesses unannounced
and we are going to win them back.

489
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,374
With gift baskets?

490
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,459
With peanut brittle,

491
00:25:03,626 --> 00:25:08,126
with macadamia nut cookies,
with chocolate turtles,

492
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,340
with raspberry jam, and
a little bit of fat and salt.

493
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,931
Because you know what?
That's what people like.

494
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,766
Ever since I was a kid,

495
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,060
people have been telling
me that I can't do things.

496
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,937
"You can't be on the team.

497
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,856
"You can't move on
to second grade."

498
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:29,068
Well, now they're telling me
that I can't win back clients

499
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,487
using old-fashioned
business methods.

500
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,114
We'll see about that.

501
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:38,907
And FYI, I eventually aced second
grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.

502
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:44,788
Okay, we're gonna split up into teams.
Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me, Andy.

503
00:25:45,626 --> 00:25:47,294
I'm not driving with him.

504
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,046
I'll go with you,
Stanley. Or him.

505
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,172
Why don't we just go
by ourselves?

506
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:53,592
Why don't we just go as teams to
demonstrate our teamsmanship?

507
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:54,760
Michael?
Yes.

508
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,512
This is stupid.
Well, that's... Okay.

509
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,139
That's not helpful, Phyllis.

510
00:25:58,222 --> 00:26:01,099
How is giving people gift baskets
going to get our clients back?

511
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,352
Gift baskets are
amazing, Phyllis.

512
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,105
Gift baskets are

513
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,443
the essence of class
and fanciness.

514
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:13,195
They are the ultimate present
that a person can receive.

515
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,364
What about cash? With cash
you can buy whatever you want,

516
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,326
including a gift basket. So,
it's kind of the best gift ever.

517
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,036
What about a gift basket
full of cash?

518
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,872
Yes. Cash basket.
Nice work, Tuna.

519
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,415
Fine. I'm just gonna
go by myself.

520
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,754
And I am going to win them back by
myself because this is important to me.

521
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,047
Michael, wait.

522
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,799
Let me go.

523
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,344
No, this is my quest.

524
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:38,804
Please. Let me go.

525
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,932
I need to win
those clients back.

526
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,517
Please.

527
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,852
Fine.

528
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,230
Then Godspeed
to both of us.

529
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,983
Good luck, Michael.

530
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,319
We don't need luck.

531
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,362
Yeah.
But thank you.

532
00:26:55,446 --> 00:26:57,281
That was really nice of you
to say. - Thank you.

533
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,867
Business to business,
the old-fashioned way,

534
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,370
no BlackBerries,
no websites.

535
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:07,833
I would like to see a website
deliver baskets of food to people.

536
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,754
Yes, I understand that, David.

537
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,257
I just felt that if we
were to downsize Kelly

538
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,135
and then outsource customer service
to India, which a lot of companies...

539
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,514
Yeah. No.
Yes, Kelly is Indian.

540
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:23,640
I understand that's confusing.

541
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,352
Hey, bro, I've been
meaning to ask you,

542
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,437
can we get some
Red Bull for these things?

543
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:32,608
Sometimes a guy's got to ride
the bull. Am I right? Later, skater.

544
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,364
Sweet ride.
American-made.

545
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:39,781
What happened
to the Sebring?

546
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,076
It is in the body shop.

547
00:27:42,743 --> 00:27:45,162
I had to have the dent taken out
of the hood where I hit Meredith.

548
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,455
Oh, that's a pain
in the ass.

549
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,623
I know.

550
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,500
So, who's next?
Larry Meyers.

551
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,503
Left us six months ago
for Office Depot.

552
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,716
Proceed to the highlighted
route, then route guidance will begin.

553
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,175
Why do you
use that thing?

554
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,135
It lets them know where
you are at all times.

555
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:01,386
Who?

556
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,599
The government, spy
satellites, private detectives,

557
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:07,935
ex-girlfriends.

558
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,781
Next night, I'm out at a bar, 2:00
a.m. I figure I'll get a sandwich,

559
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,033
'cause you can get a
sandwich any time of the night,

560
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:24,743
I run into Vince Vaughn.

561
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,203
No way.

562
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,371
Literally.

563
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,082
Dude, you are so money,

564
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,043
but you don't even
know it, but you do.

565
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,255
Later, guys.
Yeah.

566
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,466
Later, dude.
Later, man.

567
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,597
Jim, how awesome
is Ryan now?

568
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:48,016
Yeah. He's
definitely something.

569
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:49,726
What does that mean?

570
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,104
That whole lifestyle, his whole
vibe, you find that appealing?

571
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,524
Tuna.

572
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,235
Tuna, Tuna, Tuna.

573
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,862
Tuna, Tuna, Tuna.

574
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,615
He has a Killer job.
He's rich.

575
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:07,536
He smells like what I think Pierce
Brosnan probably smells like.

576
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,205
He wears really cool
rich-guy clothes.

577
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:13,875
And he can get
any girl that he wants.

578
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,338
So, I'm sorry, Tuna, but if you
don't know why that's awesome,

579
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,714
then

580
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,717
you need awesome lessons.

581
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,969
Tuna, check you later.

582
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,681
"Cause he's so money
that he doesn't even know it.

583
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:30,184
Wow, those things
are heavy.

584
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,353
There's a lot
of stuff in there.

585
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:36,606
We have macadamia
nut cookies,

586
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,193
the honey mustard pretzels.

587
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,071
Have you ever
tried focaccia crisps?

588
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:43,864
You know we closed our
account with you, right?

589
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,991
Yes. We do. We're
with Office Depot now.

590
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,701
Yes.
Yes. Yes, we know.

591
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,037
But we just have not
gotten over you. Well...

592
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,207
And we are dedicated to providing
you with the very best customer service...

593
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,583
This is...
...the very best

594
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,252
personal business
relationship... That's exactly right.

595
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:59,838
...we can if you ever
decide to come back to us.

596
00:29:59,922 --> 00:30:02,382
Okay. I don't think
we're coming back.

597
00:30:02,466 --> 00:30:04,801
Please come back.
Okay, you know what?

598
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:06,595
Just enjoy
the gift basket

599
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,182
and remember that we provide
a personal touch.

600
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,976
Remember what we had,
Larry.

601
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:13,810
I mean, really,
it's about money.

602
00:30:13,894 --> 00:30:16,021
Well, just enjoy
the gift basket.

603
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,357
Okay, thanks.
All right.

604
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,317
I mean, their website's
really easy to use, too.

605
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,111
That's a big deal for us.

606
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,364
That guy was so...

607
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,533
How can they not know
how much better we are?

608
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,910
I don't know. Sometimes
people are just impossible

609
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,705
and they make you
miserable. That is true.

610
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,206
Like Angela
in accounting.

611
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,457
Yes. She is nuts.

612
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:39,461
No, she's wonderful
at accounting.

613
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,630
But she drives me crazy.

614
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,966
Make the next right turn.

615
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,344
How do they know? How
does this know where to turn?

616
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:49,054
That's very impressive.

617
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,972
Hey, Pam,

618
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,310
I haven't settled on a final design
logo yet for Dunder Mifflin Infinity

619
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,186
and I know you're
into graphic design.

620
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,855
Do you want to give it a shot?
Maybe try and design the logo.

621
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:00,565
Totally.
Cool.

622
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,484
That would be great.

623
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,737
Can you do a couple mock-ups
and I'll take a look?

624
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,862
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

625
00:31:05,946 --> 00:31:06,988
Thank you.
Cool.

626
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,157
Okay.

627
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:18,371
Yeah, I'm going to do some mock-ups
and then turn those into thumbnails,

628
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,713
maybe do some
splash frames...

629
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,716
I don't know what I'm
talking about, but I'm excited.

630
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:29,553
And the last guy says,
"No, hairy body."

631
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,055
You know,
I have heard it before.

632
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:34,307
Ah. Well, it's
still very good.

633
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,978
I bet I know someone
who hasn't heard that joke,

634
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,521
your daughter Emily.

635
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:40,689
How's she doing?

636
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,192
She's great.
Thanks for asking.

637
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,818
Great memory, by the way.

638
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:47,195
Is she gonna be,
like, 11 this winter?

639
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,698
Wow. They grow up so fast.

640
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,368
I have a few of my own
that I want someday.

641
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:55,537
Listen, I don't want to take
any more of your time.

642
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:56,705
I know you're
a very busy man.

643
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,291
The reason we have
stopped by is to drop you off

644
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,875
this elaborate bag of goodies
and to ask you to reconsider.

645
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,840
Okay.

646
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,342
Okay. Okay.
So you'll reconsider?

647
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,344
Okay, thanks for the goodies.

648
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,429
Ah.

649
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,269
Is that all
you have to say?

650
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:22,856
It looks delicious.
I don't know.

651
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,483
You don't know?

652
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,779
Look, we want you back.

653
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,281
Can you offer lower prices?

654
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:32,532
Well, no.

655
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:33,783
Well, then,
we're not coming back.

656
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,244
He's not coming back.
It's over, Michael.

657
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:36,703
No, it's not.
No, he's right.

658
00:32:36,787 --> 00:32:38,371
No. Accept it. Why
would he come back?

659
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,916
Why would he come back?
I will tell you, Dwight.

660
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,500
He would come back because we
offer a wide selection of products,

661
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,465
and because you're definitely not
getting the same sort of customer service

662
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,550
that you get with us,
are you?

663
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:50,842
That's not gonna
change his mind.

664
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:53,929
He's moving on. We had
our chance and we killed it.

665
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:00,394
Look.

666
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,108
We're also coming out
with a website soon.

667
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,027
It's a
state-of-the-art thing.

668
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,112
It'll be up and running.

669
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:15,446
It's gonna cut costs, and it will
make ordering much, much easier.

670
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,245
Okay. Well, when it's up,
I'll check it out,

671
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:21,206
and if it really cuts costs,
maybe we'll come back.

672
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:24,501
Great. The magic of
the gift basket.

673
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,128
That I don't care
about as much.

674
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,213
Let me know
when the site's up.

675
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,423
Okay. Good.

676
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,552
Don't let Emily have any of the
Cajun almonds. She's allergic.

677
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,848
Proceed straight.

678
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,934
Well, we're 0 for 6.

679
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,269
Last chance is the
Elmhurst Country Club.

680
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,772
Other side of the lake
on the southeast side.

681
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,273
I don't get it.

682
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,276
I really don't get it.
I thought this would work.

683
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,028
I threw everything I had
at that guy and nothing.

684
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:54,364
That's how it goes
sometimes, you know?

685
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:57,826
You lose everything
and everything falls apart

686
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,703
and eventually you die

687
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,996
and no one
remembers you.

688
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,623
That is a very
good point, Dwight.

689
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:04,374
Make a right turn.

690
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,378
Wait, wait. No, no, no.
It means bear right.

691
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:11,381
No. It said right. It said
take a right. Up there.

692
00:34:11,465 --> 00:34:12,674
No, no, no, look.

693
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:16,511
It means go up to the right,
bear right over the bridge

694
00:34:16,595 --> 00:34:17,596
and hook up with 307.

695
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,515
Make a right
turn. Maybe it's a shortcut, Dwight.

696
00:34:19,598 --> 00:34:20,599
It said go to the right.

697
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,684
It can't mean that.

698
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:22,768
There's a lake there!
I think it

699
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,352
knows where it is going.
This is the lake!

700
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,645
The machine knows!
This is the lake!

701
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,105
Stop yelling at me!
No!

702
00:34:27,189 --> 00:34:29,733
Stop yelling!
There's no road here!

703
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,987
Remain calm.
I have trained for this.

704
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,489
Okay.

705
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,366
Exit the window! Here we go.

706
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,076
Make a U-turn, if possible.

707
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,203
Look out for leeches!

708
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,832
Michael! Are you okay?

709
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:49,127
Swim for it!
I got you. I got you.

710
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,213
Oh, God.

711
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,258
Michael! Michael!

712
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:55,592
Let go. Let go of me.

713
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,885
Michael.

714
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,681
I got you! I got you!

715
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,935
Come on. Come on. Come on.

716
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,605
Come on.

717
00:35:33,213 --> 00:35:34,589
You sure you're okay?

718
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:35,965
Fine.

719
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,386
Good. That is what's
most important.

720
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,555
Did you get the
rental insurance?

721
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:45,725
Because that is pretty
important, too, at a time like this.

722
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,069
What a disaster.
This whole thing.

723
00:35:57,279 --> 00:35:58,863
I'll call a cab.

724
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:03,447
These people just don't realize what
a gift basket means. They don't get it.

725
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:05,870
Look at that. Still works.
Old-fashioned cell phone.

726
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:09,123
Yeah. What about that
last guy, Aaron?

727
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:12,961
Boy, is he a jerk. I don't
even know if I want it.

728
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,213
"Their website is so easy."

729
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:18,967
Yeah, well, you can have
your technology, jackass.

730
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,093
Look where it got us.

731
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,512
Yes, we need a cab
at Lake Scranton

732
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:25,140
at the end of East
Mountain Road, in the lake.

733
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,475
Hang up.

734
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,977
You know what
we're gonna do?

735
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,687
We're walking back.

736
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,481
We're walking back
to that office

737
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:35,984
and we're going to
reclaim our gift basket.

738
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,071
Yes. We're going to
take what's rightfully ours.

739
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:41,364
We're gonna take
a stand, Dwight.

740
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,993
We're gonna take a stand!
Take a stand!

741
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,579
So it plays on the infinity thing
without being obvious, you know?

742
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,164
Yeah. Definitely.

743
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,166
I'd love to do like
a color version,

744
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,418
just bring a little
color to it. I like it a lot.

745
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,504
It's clear and subtle
at the same time.

746
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:58,172
It's really good. You have
a real talent for this stuff.

747
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,801
Thanks. I'd love to talk
to you about it more.

748
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:01,968
That would be great.

749
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,137
Do you want to go
out to dinner tonight?

750
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,890
Oh, is it...

751
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,725
Wear something nice.
No.

752
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,893
What?

753
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,686
I just...
I'm sorry.

754
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,229
I just want to have dinner.

755
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,941
I'm dating Jim.

756
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,902
You're kidding.

757
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,823
We're together.

758
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,870
That's great. I...
That's awesome.

759
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,330
Yeah. Great.

760
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:36,127
So, let me...
Yeah.

761
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,380
Let me look at these.
Okay. Great.

762
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,882
Cool.
Great.

763
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,852
I guess he can't get
any girl he wants.

764
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,072
Did you forget something?
What happened to you guys?

765
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,574
Give it back.

766
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:09,327
The gift basket.
Give it back.

767
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:10,453
Oh, what is this?

768
00:38:10,537 --> 00:38:11,704
It's real simple.

769
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,709
If you don't appreciate what we
do, then give us back our basket.

770
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,795
Maybe you should leave.

771
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,046
Yeah. Maybe we should...

772
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,257
Maybe we should leave.
Come on, let's leave.

773
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,425
But before we leave,

774
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:28,009
my wet friend and I are gonna wait
for our cabs on your nice couches.

775
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,516
Can you call us a cab, please?
I'm gonna... Sorry.

776
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,310
My clothes
are so wet.

777
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:34,769
Nice leather.

778
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:37,313
Oh, my shoes are so muddy.

779
00:38:37,397 --> 00:38:39,982
All right, here you go.
Take it back.

780
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,651
It's been opened.
Yeah, it was mine.

781
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:45,155
What's missing?
The turtles.

782
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:46,448
Summer sausage.
Where are the turtles?

783
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,492
Where are the turtles?
Come on, guys, get out of here.

784
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:53,075
Where are the turtles?
Where are they?

785
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,497
Excuse me, I have an
announcement to make.

786
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:57,500
We seem to be missing a box
of chocolate turtles with pecans

787
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:00,128
and we will not be leaving the
premises until we obtain them.

788
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,715
Hand over the turtles now!

789
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:07,218
I ate them, okay? I ate
the turtles. They're gone.

790
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,067
We'll bill you.

791
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:27,405
May I have your
attention, please?

792
00:39:27,489 --> 00:39:31,493
This office will not be using
any new technology ever.

793
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,662
Starting now.
That is not correct.

794
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:38,166
Ryan thinks that technology is
the answer. Well, guess what?

795
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,210
I just drove my car
into a lake.

796
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,461
You did what?

797
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,590
I drove my car
into a lake.

798
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,678
Why, you may ask,
did I do this?

799
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:51,971
Well, because of a machine.

800
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:56,555
A machine told me to
drive into a lake. And I did it.

801
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:01,106
I did it because I trusted
Ryan's precious technology.

802
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:02,315
And look where it got me.

803
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,400
Into a lake.

804
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:04,484
Exactly.

805
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,570
Did you get
any clients back?

806
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,780
Maybe. Maybe not.

807
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,156
Time will tell.

808
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:13,576
But I will tell you one thing,
those gift baskets

809
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,329
never endangered
anybody's lives.

810
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,834
Game, set, match.

811
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,965
Point. Scott. Game over.

812
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:30,468
End of game.

813
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,399
Everyone always
wants new things.

814
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,862
Everybody likes new
inventions, new technology.

815
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:52,156
People will never be
replaced by machines.

816
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,535
In the end, life and business
are about human connections.

817
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:01,916
And computers are about
trying to murder you in a lake.

818
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,961
And to me
the choice is easy.

819
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:12,798
I'm not saying I had a
meteoric rise, but I did.

820
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:17,349
And if they knew how much I
was paying for my haircut now,

821
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:19,642
they wouldn't be
giving me a noogie.

822
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,186
It was $200.
