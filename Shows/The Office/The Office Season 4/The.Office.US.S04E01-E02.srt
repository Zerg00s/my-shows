1
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,802
Okay, well, I did not
get the job in New York,

2
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,431
but I got the real prize,
domestic bliss.

3
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,934
Jan made me breakfast
this morning.

4
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:21,895
Well, she bought the milk.

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,482
It's soy.

6
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,401
This is why I do it.

7
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:31,071
That's
what I have to come home to.

8
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,911
She probably won't
be up for a few hours.

9
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:41,748
This is going to be a
very good year. Very good.

10
00:00:42,124 --> 00:00:46,624
Jan is at home. Jim is back. My
protégé Ryan is at corporate. Good stuff.

11
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:53,886
Andy and Dwight are rocking
the sales team. I feel very blessed.

12
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:39,097
You know, generally it's not a good
idea to click on any Internet offers

13
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,309
that you haven't requested.
What was the exact offer?

14
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,937
It was for a video.

15
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,397
Yeah. What kind of video?

16
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,525
A celebrity sex tape.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,403
Really?
What kind of celebrity?

18
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,364
It's not relevant.
How much did you pay for it?

19
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,782
Not relevant.
You paid for it?

20
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,659
It all happened
so fast.

21
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,495
I broke up with Karen
after the job interview.

22
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,247
And it was

23
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,917
a little awkward when she
came back from the city.

24
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,586
She told me very clearly that
just because we were broken up

25
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,296
didn't mean that
she was going anywhere,

26
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,132
because she had worked
really hard for her career,

27
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,593
but the next day
her desk was empty.

28
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,057
And as for me and my
current romantic life...

29
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,893
I am single now
and looking.

30
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,189
So, if you
know anybody...

31
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:32,109
Jim and I went to dinner a few times
when he got back from New York.

32
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,278
I talked him
through his breakup.

33
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,531
It's really nice to
be good friends again.

34
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:42,782
Are you kidding me? Pam
and Jim are totally hooking up.

35
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,247
All they do is smile.

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,208
They're just keeping it
a secret. Right?

37
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't know. There is
no evidence of intimacy.

38
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,630
They've been in
remarkably good moods.

39
00:02:53,714 --> 00:02:54,798
It could be
other things.

40
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,717
Are you kidding me?

41
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,930
And Sunday, I'm thinking of going
to that flea market at the drive-in.

42
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:05,475
That sounds fun. I'm mountain biking
on Sunday on Montage Mountain.

43
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,560
Cool.
Yeah.

44
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,062
Well,
have fun with that.

45
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,071
Ladies and gentlemen,

46
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:19,990
I have some bad news.

47
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,367
Meredith was
hit by a car.

48
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,161
What? Where?
Oh, my God.

49
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,330
It happened this morning
in the parking lot.

50
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,914
I took her to the hospital and
the doctors tried to save her life.

51
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,420
They did the best
that they could

52
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,298
and she is
going to be okay.

53
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,469
What is wrong with you? Why
did you have to phrase it like that?

54
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,971
So she's really
going to be fine?

55
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:46,554
Yes. She has a
slight pelvical fracture,

56
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,269
but people have
survived far worse.

57
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,064
Thank God
you were there.

58
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,107
Yeah.

59
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,817
Did you see
who did it?

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,070
Oh, no need. We can just
check the security tapes.

61
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,030
Yeah. Kind of a
good-news-bad-news there.

62
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,614
I was able to be on the scene so quickly
because I was in the car that hit her.

63
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,414
Who was driving?

64
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,711
Oh, Michael.

65
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,883
One day Michael came in complaining
about a speed bump on the highway.

66
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,303
I wonder who
he ran over then.

67
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,222
It's only Meredith.

68
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,976
Yeah. It's only
Meredith. Thank God.

69
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,061
But did you see the way
they looked at me?

70
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,313
Like I was a murderer
or something.

71
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,773
Hey...

72
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,609
Why did you do it?

73
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:38,860
It was an accident.

74
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,153
Was she
talking back?

75
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,321
No.

76
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,032
Just got sick of that face?
Did she owe you money?

77
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,161
Is this downsizing?

78
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,995
Did she spurn
your advances?

79
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:54,167
Hey, guys. We're all going
to visit Meredith at lunch

80
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,336
and we're kicking
in $5 for flowers.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,213
Who's "we,"
you and Jim?

82
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,757
No. Me and Stanley
and Phyllis, so far.

83
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,552
Oh, I bet
Jim goes, too.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,971
Yeah, I haven't
asked him yet.

85
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,639
Oh, I bet you ask.

86
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:08,890
I was planning on it.

87
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,268
I bet you were.

88
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:13,728
Subtle.

89
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,980
What?
Are you coming?

90
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,191
I can't.
Sprinkles is sick.

91
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,817
She's been sick
for some time.

92
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,738
Thank you for asking.
No one asks about Sprinkles.

93
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,783
I have to give her her
meds. I have to pet her.

94
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,618
And who will she
eat lunch with?

95
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,537
Can't your other cats
keep her company?

96
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,624
There's bad blood,
jealousies, cliques...

97
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,793
Angela, you're the chairman of
the Party Planning Committee.

98
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:40,005
I shouldn't even be
planning this. It's your job.

99
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,716
All right.

100
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,178
- My lord, my liege!
- Yes, Michael?

101
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,138
So Ryan got
promoted to corporate

102
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,933
where he is a little fish
in a big pond.

103
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,143
Whereas,
back here in Scranton,

104
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,895
I am still top dog

105
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,316
in a fairly large pond.

106
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:03,486
So, who is the real boss,

107
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,699
the dog or a fish?

108
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,161
So I need a little
treat for the gang,

109
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,330
something to win
their affections back.

110
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,791
Back?
Why is that, Michael?

111
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,794
Well, I ran down
Meredith in my car.

112
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,005
Oh! Did you do
this on purpose?

113
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:25,008
No, I was being negligent, but
she's in the hospital, she's fine.

114
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,969
Recovering nicely, tiny
little crack in her pelvis,

115
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,222
but she will be up and... Did
this happen on company property?

116
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,806
Yes. It was on company property with
company property, so double jeopardy.

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,021
We are fine.

118
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:39,022
I don't think
you understand

119
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,857
how jeopardy works.

120
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,235
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
What is "We're fine"?

121
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,742
People keep calling me a "wunderkind."
I don't even know what that means.

122
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,705
I mean, I know what it means. It
means very successful for your age.

123
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:58,124
So I guess it makes sense,
but it's a weird word.

124
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,670
Hey, D.
Hey, monkey, what's up?

125
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,963
Can you do me
a little favor?

126
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,215
Go to my place at lunch and
give Sprinkles her medicine?

127
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,383
Sure.

128
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,551
I have to
visit the alkie.

129
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:09,636
Check to see
if she's faking.

130
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,931
If a car hit me, it
wouldn't crack my pelvis.

131
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,475
You know what? I bet
she cracked it at home,

132
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,186
jumped in front of the car
to get some worker's comp.

133
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,063
I wouldn't
put it past her.

134
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:23,441
So what do you
need me to do?

135
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,902
I wrote it out.
There's a diabetes shot.

136
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,405
Roll the insulin in your
hands. Don't shake it.

137
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,783
She gets an ACE inhibitor with her meal. You
have to put her right in front of the dish

138
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,160
or she won't see it
because of the cataracts.

139
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:38,206
Mix one capsule of omega fatty
acid in with her kidney medicine.

140
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,585
And you want to give that to
her 15 minutes after she's eaten.

141
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,463
And... Oh,
there's a fungal cream

142
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,172
because she has this
infection under her tail,

143
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,799
SO you're going to
have to lift her tail

144
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,968
and put the cream right
at the base of her tail.

145
00:07:50,552 --> 00:07:52,971
Okay, I have
an announcement.

146
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,598
You pushed Darryl
out the window? No.

147
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,975
You shot Dwight? No.
No. That is not funny.

148
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,937
I love my employees even
though I hit one of you with my car,

149
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,316
for which I take
full responsibility.

150
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,900
Look, I'm just trying to take everybody's
mind off of this unavoidable tragedy

151
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,032
and on to more
positive things,

152
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,410
so I thought we
should plant a tree.

153
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,913
Oh, good. At least
we don't have to work.

154
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,707
Okay, we're leaving
for the hospital at 1:00.

155
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,500
So, like,
a freedom tree.

156
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:22,584
I can take
three people.

157
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,835
I can also take
three people.

158
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,920
Separate cars.

159
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,714
Pam? All right,
we'll get a card at the hospital

160
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,048
and we'll sign it
outside her room.

161
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,342
Pam? Sales people
can go later in the day.

162
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,635
Hourly workers
can go at lunch.

163
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,888
Okay, good, good, so we'll just
all go down there together at lunch.

164
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,264
Excellent. I was
thinking that we...

165
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,640
Good work, Pam.
But if we...

166
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,309
Yay! I think it
would be a lot...

167
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,519
Pam!

168
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:43,563
All right, since I am the
boss, I will drive as well.

169
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:45,649
Who wants shotgun?
You can't be serious.

170
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,192
You ran a woman
over this morning.

171
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,988
Everyone inside the
car was fine, Stanley!

172
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,242
Guess what? I have
flaws. What are they?

173
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:57,702
Oh, I don't know.
I sing in the shower.

174
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,998
Sometimes, I spend too
much time volunteering.

175
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:04,876
Occasionally, I'll hit somebody
with my car. So sue me.

176
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:09,752
No, don't sue me. That's the opposite
of the point that I'm trying to make.

177
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,931
I hate hospitals. In my
mind, they are associated with sickness.

178
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,566
She looks
like an angel.

179
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,025
She looks awful.

180
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:32,112
No? Okay, she always looks
like that. It was not my fault.

181
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,906
I think she's awake.

182
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,324
No, she's in a coma.

183
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:39,869
No.

184
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,958
Okay. Meredith?

185
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,214
I brought all your friends
from the office, dear.

186
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:52,966
At the same time.
Yeah.

187
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,051
Hello, Meredith.

188
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,176
This is weird.

189
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,053
Brought you
some balloons.

190
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,139
Why don't we...
Here you go.

191
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,685
Tie these up. Cheer up
your tubes. Oh, shoot.

192
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,479
Oh,
for God's sake.

193
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:06,813
Nurse!

194
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,649
No, don't bother the nurse.
Just put it back in.

195
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,570
I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to puke.

196
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,822
I'm going to puke. I wouldn't
worry about it. Don't touch it.

197
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,783
What... What are you
doing? Just give me that.

198
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,829
Thanks.

199
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:26,499
Does it
hurt terribly?

200
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,917
No. It's not too bad.

201
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,210
They have me on
a lot of painkillers.

202
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,587
Oh, really?
What kind?

203
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:35,171
Codeine? Vicodin? Percocet?
Fentanyl? OxyContin? Palladone?

204
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,427
What?
I have no idea.

205
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,930
Well, it was really great of all of you
to come and visit me at the same time.

206
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,353
I'll see you guys
at the office.

207
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,562
Okay.

208
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,815
Okay. Wait up. Wait up.
Guys, guys, guys. Hold on a sec.

209
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:53,735
You know what I was
thinking might be sort of fun,

210
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,197
is if you forgave me
in front of everybody.

211
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,782
Michael,
I'm not going to do that.

212
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,619
"Cause you know what they
say in the Bible about forgiveness?

213
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,956
Forgiveness is
next to godliness.

214
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,668
No, that's not what
they... Well, just... Just...

215
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:10,918
You cracked my pelvis.

216
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,213
Look, I just...
I don't understand

217
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,257
what is preventing you
from laughing this off

218
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,591
and giving me a big hug.

219
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,301
You are not forgiven.

220
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,511
Come on.

221
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,722
Michael! Michael!

222
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,223
Michael!

223
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,728
Do I need to be liked?
Absolutely not. I like to be liked.

224
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,147
I enjoy being liked.
I have to be liked,

225
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:36,148
but it's not like this
compulsive need to be liked,

226
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,865
like my need
to be praised.

227
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,703
Hey.

228
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:46,204
Hey, monkey.

229
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,705
Any problems?

230
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:50,583
Well, you left the TV on,
and your cat is dead.

231
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,754
What? Sparkles, the
white one, is dead.

232
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:54,963
Sprinkles.

233
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,757
That was the sick one, right?

234
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,889
I thought
she had more time.

235
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,390
No.

236
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,978
Did she look...

237
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:12,730
When you saw her,
how was she looking?

238
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,232
Really dead.

239
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,693
Like,
just a dead cat.

240
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,322
So... Hey, come on,
don't be sad.

241
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:23,825
Just... Okay?
Just...

242
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:25,577
She's in
a better place.

243
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,828
All right.

244
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:32,413
Actually, the place that she's in
is the freezer because of the odor.

245
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,591
It's going
to be okay.

246
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,259
Okay, you know what?

247
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,387
Everybody, let's just get
over the whole Meredith thing.

248
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:48,558
She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little
crack, and she's going to be fine.

249
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,643
So, let's just...

250
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,394
Michael,
Angela's cat died.

251
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,272
Sprinkles?

252
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,825
Oh, shoot.

253
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,329
I'm sorry, Angela.
Man, what a day, huh?

254
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,248
How could it
get any worse?

255
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:14,292
The computer crashes
with the porn,

256
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,045
and then Meredith with
the accident, and then...

257
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,964
Prinkles! God...

258
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,342
That's three things.

259
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,846
I'll tell you what's going
on. This office is cursed.

260
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,600
And we need to do
something about it.

261
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,229
Well, I am taking
responsibility, and it is up to me

262
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,813
to get rid of the curse
that hit Meredith with my car.

263
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:44,363
I'm not superstitious,
but I am a little stitious.

264
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:50,077
Did anyone do anything
involving an Indian burial ground?

265
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,164
Like what?
Like park on it.

266
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,874
Or dig up a body.

267
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,212
Toby, do you have
anything you want to tell us?

268
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:03,925
No. I did not violate
an Indian burial ground.

269
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:07,220
In fact, I had some good luck
recently. Alfredo's Pizza picked

270
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,057
my business card out of the
basket. So, I get a week of free pies.

271
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,433
That's cool.
Yeah.

272
00:14:12,517 --> 00:14:15,770
Perfect. So our tragedy
is your good luck.

273
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,773
Satan.

274
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,942
Sprinkles never
hurt a soul.

275
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,154
God, in your infinite
wisdom, how can you do this?

276
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:27,323
She wasn't ready. She had
so much left to accomplish.

277
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,367
It is only a cat.

278
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,245
You never...
You don't like them.

279
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,415
Cats do not provide
milk or wool or meat.

280
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,625
Dwight.

281
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,209
Dwight, you haven't seen
Meredith yet, have you?

282
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,294
No, I have not.
Well,

283
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,506
I think you should go to the
hospital and pay your respects.

284
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,091
I do not respect her,
but I will go.

285
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,927
All right,

286
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:52,511
I would now like to talk about each
of your individual religious beliefs.

287
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,561
Michael, you can't ask
about religious beliefs.

288
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,147
Satan is
a master of lies.

289
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,942
Everything he says
is the opposite.

290
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,652
All right, well, then you can
ask about religious beliefs.

291
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,821
Thank you for the
permission. Psych.

292
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:10,491
All right, let's just go around the
room and tell me what you believe in.

293
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,535
I'm a Catholic.

294
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:14,370
Okay.
Presbyterian.

295
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:15,580
All right.
Me, too.

296
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,748
For real?
Same religion.

297
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,084
All right.

298
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,502
I'm a Lutheran and
Bob is a Unitarian.

299
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,962
It keeps things spicy.

300
00:15:23,046 --> 00:15:24,756
That's why
we're cursed.

301
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,802
I've been involved IN a number of
cults, both as a leader and a follower.

302
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,595
You have more fun
as a follower.

303
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,639
But you make more
money as a leader.

304
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,184
Kelly, you are Hindu,
so you believe in Buddha.

305
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,978
That's Buddhists.

306
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,229
Are you sure?
No.

307
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:42,732
What are you?

308
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:47,278
Well, if you're going to reduce my
identity to my religion, then I'm Sikh.

309
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,781
But I also like
hip-hop and NPR,

310
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,159
and I'm restoring a 1967
Corvette in my spare time.

311
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:57,622
Okay. So one Sikh and...

312
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,835
As a farmer, I know
that when an animal is sick,

313
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:05,421
sometimes the right thing to
do is to put it out of its misery.

314
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:08,424
With the electricity we're
using to keep Meredith alive,

315
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,552
we could power a
small fan for two days.

316
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,638
You tell me
what's unethical.

317
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,516
Blink once if you want
me to pull the plug.

318
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,310
Don't pull any plugs. All right.

319
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,479
How are you doing,
Ms. Palmer? Better.

320
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,148
Excellent. Are you a
doctor or a male nurse?

321
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm an intern, which
makes me a doctor.

322
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,572
Her chart doesn't indicate
that she had a hysterectomy.

323
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:33,449
But she did, or at least
she got time off for one.

324
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,162
So that is where
her uterus went.

325
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,831
Ms. Palmer,
your last tetanus shot

326
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,750
was when you were bitten
by a bat a few months ago?

327
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,545
Yes. Dwight, here, trapped
it in a bag against my head.

328
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,672
Just doing my job.

329
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,758
It also says you were
recently bitten by a raccoon.

330
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:51,259
And a rat.

331
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,010
Separate occasions.

332
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:57,473
You spend your whole life
trying to get people to like you,

333
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:01,435
and then you run over
one person with your car,

334
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,273
and it's not even one of the popular
ones, and everybody gets on your case.

335
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,400
It doesn't
make any sense.

336
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,152
God is dead.

337
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,364
If there was a God, then Ryan
and I would be married by now.

338
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,158
Maybe believing
in God was a mistake.

339
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,369
What did people
believe in before?

340
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,247
The sun?

341
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,500
Maybe there's
some sort of animal

342
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,794
that we could make
a sacrifice to,

343
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:30,131
like a giant buffalo,

344
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:34,094
or some sort
of monster,

345
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:37,555
like something with
the body of a walrus

346
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,683
with the head of

347
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,019
a sea lion.

348
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,606
Or something with
the body of an egret

349
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,943
with the head
of a meerkat.

350
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,571
Or just

351
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,950
the head of a monkey with

352
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,745
the antlers of a reindeer

353
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,916
with the body of

354
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,252
a

355
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,298
porcupine.

356
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:15,885
I will do
some research.

357
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,011
Okay.

358
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,096
I can help you
with that.

359
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,346
Okay.

360
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:25,144
So, just to be safe, they are
giving her the rabies vaccine.

361
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:27,271
Oh, God, rabies?

362
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,733
I was in the hospital
room with her.

363
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:31,818
How contagious
is that?

364
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,152
Is that like an STD? No. No.

365
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,278
You've got to be
bitten by something.

366
00:18:34,362 --> 00:18:36,238
This place is
SO cursed.

367
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,825
Actually, the doctor said it was
lucky she came into the hospital,

368
00:18:38,908 --> 00:18:40,075
because the only
way to beat rabies

369
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,829
IS to start treatment
before the symptoms set in.

370
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:44,330
Lockjaw.

371
00:18:50,837 --> 00:18:54,632
I know a lot of you are very upset
with me for endangering Meredith's life

372
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,176
by hitting her
with my car.

373
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:02,182
But it may make you feel a little bit
better to know that before that happened,

374
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:06,352
Dwight endangered her life by
putting a garbage bag over her head

375
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,229
that had a bat in it.

376
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,148
Six of one, really.

377
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:14,731
Turns out Meredith has
been exposed to rabies,

378
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,570
which is like 10 times worse
than a little crack in your pelvis.

379
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:23,703
Thanks to me, she went to the
hospital and that saved her life.

380
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,413
Curse is broken.

381
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,834
Curse is broken, people.
Oh, there is a God.

382
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,961
And he has a plan
for us after all.

383
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,545
So go home, get some rest.
Very, very good work today.

384
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,552
Got a lot
accomplished.

385
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:45,307
Is there a God? If not, what
are all these churches for?

386
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,103
And who is Jesus' dad?

387
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:02,783
Oh, well, if they aren't together
now, then they probably never will be.

388
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,040
I thought they'd be good
together, like PB and ♪.

389
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,544
Pam Beasley and Jim.

390
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:16,964
What a waste.

391
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,883
What a waste.

392
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,845
I told you
I'm not dating anyone.

393
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:24,722
And even if I was,

394
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,475
I don't think
it's anyone's business.

395
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,646
I mean, when I do fall in
love, like, when it's for real,

396
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,150
the last person I'm going to
talk about it to IS a camera crew

397
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,068
or my co-workers.

398
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,867
Almost marrying Roy Anderson
was as close to Pamela Anderson

399
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,494
as I ever want to be.

400
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,747
Trust me, when I fall
in love, you'll know.

401
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,881
Michael Scott's
Dunder Mifflin Scranton

402
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,925
Meredith Palmer Memorial

403
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,845
Celebrity Rabies Awareness
Fun Run Race for the Cure.

404
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,512
This is Pam.
Pro-Am.

405
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,265
Pro-Am Race for the...
They hung up.

406
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:13,479
A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a
car to learn that she may have rabies,

407
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,315
but that is where
we are in America.

408
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:20,027
And that does not
sit right with me.

409
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:24,778
And that is why I am hosting a
fun run race for the cure for rabies.

410
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,200
To raise awareness of the fact
that there is a cure for rabies,

411
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,584
a disease that has been
largely eradicated in the US,

412
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:37,002
but not very many
people know that.

413
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:39,004
No, rabies.

414
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,549
Babies would
be a good idea.

415
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,301
Can I put you
down for a dime?

416
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:47,763
Hi, Stankley,
how many sponsors so far?

417
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:48,973
Zero.

418
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,603
Come on, man, got to step
it up. It's for a good cause.

419
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:56,522
Jan called this morning
and pledged $500.

420
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,524
And isn't that
your money?

421
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:03,612
It is for a good cause.

422
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,074
Phyllis, how's
the rabies quilt coming?

423
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:09,577
It's coming.
Oh, look at that, three.

424
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,329
Way to honor Meredith,
Phyllis. Michael?

425
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,205
Yes. You cannot make me run.

426
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:15,457
Okay. It is not a real charity.

427
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,502
It's stupid, Michael,
and I'm not going to do it.

428
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,044
All right. All right.
You didn't run for me

429
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:20,754
when I
thought I had skin cancer.

430
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,630
I know that you're probably scared of
people seeing your fat legs in shorts.

431
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:26,760
No.

432
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,889
Okay. Well, back in olden times,

433
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,394
a large, fat person like
this was a person of power.

434
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:39,231
A person who had money, could
buy food, a person of respect,

435
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:41,442
like the regional
manager of the day.

436
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,862
Whereas someone athletic
and trim like myself

437
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,656
was someone who
worked in the fields

438
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:48,240
and I was a peasant.

439
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,783
I just don't
want to run.

440
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,744
I didn't bring my
sneakers or my clothes.

441
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,037
Well, you're going
to have to run

442
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,623
or you're going to
be in a lot of trouble.

443
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,627
It is not olden times
anymore.

444
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:06,129
I'm petrified of nipple chafing.
Once it starts, it is a vicious circle.

445
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:11,054
You have sensitive nipples, they
chafe. So they become more sensitive,

446
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,723
so they chafe more.

447
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,434
So I take precautions.

448
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,855
Hey, Angela.

449
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,151
Hey, I'm sorry
about your cat.

450
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,995
This is Sprinkles.
She was my best friend.

451
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:38,082
I kept her going through
countless ailments.

452
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:43,083
I asked Dwight Schrute to feed
her once and she is now deceased.

453
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:50,302
This is Halloween
last year.

454
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,681
Just a couple
of kittens

455
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,434
out on the town.

456
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,357
Pssst.

457
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,574
I'm having
relationship problems,

458
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:14,535
and since you're always
having relationship problems,

459
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,454
I thought you'd be able
to give me some advice.

460
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:17,704
What's wrong?

461
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,624
I have this
crazy thought

462
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,375
that I know is crazy,

463
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,753
that maybe Dwight
killed my cat.

464
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:26,297
Hmm.

465
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,966
When I got home, Sprinkles'
body was in the freezer

466
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,843
where Dwight
said he left her.

467
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,472
But all my bags of frozen French
fries had been clawed to shreds.

468
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,724
Something's not right.

469
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,768
The vet's doing
an autopsy.

470
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,352
Angela, I'm sorry.

471
00:24:40,436 --> 00:24:42,688
Did Roy ever Kill
one of your cats?

472
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:45,274
I'm more of
a dog person.

473
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,489
So what's your
strategy for this race?

474
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:52,990
Well, I'm going
to start fast.

475
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,742
Then I'm going to run
fast in the middle. What?

476
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,285
Then I'm going
to end fast.

477
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,620
Why won't more
people do that?

478
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,497
"Cause they're stupid.

479
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,208
What?

480
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,683
No, that's not...

481
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:19,892
I mean, that wasn't...

482
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,560
Yeah, that was...

483
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:25,189
I mean, I can see how it
would seem a bit like we...

484
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:28,358
How it looks like...

485
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,403
But, I mean, nowadays
you can edit anything, right?

486
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:34,986
You can edit anything
to look like anything.

487
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,409
Yeah, I gave him
a ride home because...

488
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:39,495
Right.

489
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,122
...we're dating.

490
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:45,000
Wow!
There it is.

491
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,628
Yeah.

492
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,007
We haven't told anybody,
but it's going really great.

493
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,009
Right?

494
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:55,636
It is going
really great.

495
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:57,846
Ow!

496
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,431
Shut up!

497
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:02,267
You're taking this out on me,
but I was only the messenger.

498
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:03,727
Oh, really?

499
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,652
You'll feel better
after the 5K.

500
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,988
Exercise is good
for depression.

501
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,699
I'm not depressed.
I'm grieving.

502
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:21,620
We have raised
almost $700,

503
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,497
most of it
from me and Jan.

504
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:27,042
When do they put that
on the giant check,

505
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,253
or is that something
that we write in later?

506
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,298
Well, a giant check costs
about $200 to make up.

507
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,260
I have a print shop standing by,
but what do you think, Michael?

508
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,262
That's over 25%
of our funds.

509
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:42,975
That's a tough decision.

510
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,145
I always imagined it
with a giant check.

511
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:49,106
Yeah, I mean, I personally am
definitely on board for the giant check.

512
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,232
Giant check it is.

513
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:51,692
I don't know.

514
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,696
On the other hand, it does leave
less money for bat birth control.

515
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,448
Bat birth control?

516
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,118
Wait, this money is going to
bat birth control, right, Michael?

517
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,744
That's what you told
me when I contributed.

518
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,579
You didn't contribute
very much.

519
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:08,084
I was also hoping to hand the
giant check to a rabies doctor.

520
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,626
And how's that going?

521
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,589
Not well. A doctor won't come
out to collect a check for $700.

522
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,549
Or $500, if we go
with the giant check.

523
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:16,717
Which we are.

524
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,137
And also, there is no such
thing as a rabies doctor.

525
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,347
What about
a rabies nurse?

526
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:23,515
I don't think so.

527
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,311
You know what, though? I've actually seen
ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour

528
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,438
for parties and
bachelor events.

529
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,066
That's possible.
Look into that. Great.

530
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,404
It's going to cost a couple hundred
bucks and... Actually more with tips.

531
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,280
Maybe we should
skip the ceremony

532
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:41,158
and just set up a college
fund for Meredith's son.

533
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:44,578
Have you met that kid?
Not going to college.

534
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,291
Michael...

535
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,754
5K means five kilometers,
not 5,000 miles.

536
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,881
Come in!

537
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,091
Hey!
Oh, my God!

538
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,384
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

539
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,218
You said, come in! No, I didn't!

540
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,179
Just, please, get
out. Oh, my God!

541
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,933
So I closed the door
but the image of his...

542
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,977
Baguette?
...dangling participle

543
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,395
still burned
in my eyes.

544
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,730
I can imagine.

545
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,775
Come in.

546
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,569
May I enter
the room?

547
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:19,112
Yes, or come in.

548
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,241
See how I did that?

549
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,619
That's the way
you should enter a room.

550
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,162
You knock and then
you wait for the all clear.

551
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:29,206
You couldn't have taken off all
your clothes in the men's room?

552
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,834
Yes, but I have an office,
so why would I do that?

553
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:35,588
On average, how many hours a day do you
spend naked in your office, just ballpark?

554
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:38,465
European offices are naked
all the time. They're so not.

555
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:40,300
Besides, my shirttail
covered most of it, so...

556
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,511
I didn't see where it started,
but I saw where it ended.

557
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,305
Gross.
That's not gross.

558
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,890
It is a human body.
What is your problem?

559
00:28:46,974 --> 00:28:48,850
Pam, you're an artist, right?

560
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,228
Think of me as
one of your models.

561
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,354
Okay, you know what?

562
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,983
I don't want this to detract from what
we really need to be thinking about today.

563
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,360
It's not fair to
people with rabies.

564
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:01,572
And that's the point.
Right?

565
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:03,073
Okay.
Let's go have some fun.

566
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,324
All right.

567
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,454
They say if you're nervous around
someone you should picture them naked.

568
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:10,956
I do not recommend
this strategy.

569
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,919
Try picturing them with more
clothes on or a funny coat.

570
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,840
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this a working office?

571
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,884
And not
a French beach?

572
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,803
Okay, name please.

573
00:29:24,887 --> 00:29:26,889
Creed Bratton.
75-plus division.

574
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,516
You're over
75 years old?

575
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,766
Eighty-two,
November 1st.

576
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,976
How much is
the prize money?

577
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,895
There's no
prize money.

578
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,397
What?
Is any of this real?

579
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,731
Check that out.

580
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,567
"Look at me. I'm
Toby. I'm stretching.

581
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,236
"I know what I'm doing."
Why is he even here?

582
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:48,953
So I heard that you were
peeping on Michael.

583
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,495
What?
No, it was not...

584
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,708
Look, I don't know what your deal
is, but he's mine, okay? So, hands off.

585
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,878
Okay, everybody!
Listen up!

586
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,964
Thank you for coming.
Before we get started,

587
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,133
I want to say
a few words

588
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:06,595
about this deadly
disease called rabies.

589
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:11,016
And I'd like you to take a
look into the face of rabies.

590
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,647
That should scare you.
It scares me.

591
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,441
You people need
to educate yourselves.

592
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:22,486
Myth: three Americans
every year die from rabies.

593
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,070
Fact: four Americans
every year die from rabies.

594
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,161
How many of you
know someone

595
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:33,247
who has been afflicted
or affected by rabies?

596
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,959
Show of hands. One, two,
three... Too many to count.

597
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,211
It is truly
the silent killer.

598
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,756
No, it is the foaming,
barking Killer.

599
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,176
And it is something that comes...
Darryl, what are you doing?

600
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,302
I'm giving him
a peanut.

601
00:30:47,386 --> 00:30:51,886
No, don't give him... Just...
Did you hear anything I said?

602
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,016
Look how
happy he is.

603
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,810
He's happy
because he's insane.

604
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,645
You know what?
That's a perfect example

605
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,732
of the kind of awareness
we need to generate.

606
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:03,610
Where's the nurse? This
is the reason we're here.

607
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:04,820
Hello, Michael.

608
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,655
Oh, hey, I know you. Elizabeth?

609
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,615
Yeah.
Right? Wow!

610
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:11,118
Very cool. You went
back and got your degree.

611
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,246
I would like you
to accept this check

612
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,292
for $340,

613
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,669
made out to "Science."

614
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,589
Make sure that that
gets into the right hands.

615
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:24,756
Great.

616
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,429
You got it?

617
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,555
Okay.

618
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,060
Fettuccine Alfredo.

619
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,478
Time to carbo-load.

620
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,820
Just remember, folks, it's not
about winning. It is about finishing!

621
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,739
On your marks,

622
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,660
get set...

623
00:31:52,993 --> 00:31:53,994
Hey!

624
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,593
On your left!
Wow, you're fast.

625
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,347
Doing great, Michael!
Look at you go!

626
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,723
That's my boss!
Yeah!

627
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,517
Think I'm fast?

628
00:32:16,892 --> 00:32:19,978
I'm very fast.
I'm like Forrest Gump,

629
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,731
except I am
not an idiot.

630
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,277
Oh, yes,
I will work out today.

631
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,407
I will work out a way to avoid
running for a stupid cause.

632
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,995
I've walked two marathons.
I'm pretty sure I can handle a 5K.

633
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:40,832
Key is drafting,
eliminate wind resistance.

634
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,380
Yeah.

635
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,467
Oh, we're
in last place.

636
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,552
Oh, would you
look at that?

637
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:52,886
Darn it.

638
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,852
Water? Water?

639
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,481
Water, babe?
No! No water for me!

640
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,734
Not while rabies causes
fear of water! Solidarity!

641
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,653
Michael,
that's irrational.

642
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,280
Rabies victims

643
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:16,572
have to live with an irrational
hatred of water their entire lives.

644
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,329
So, the least I can do...

645
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:24,876
Oh, God, my
nipples. It's starting.

646
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,296
Can we get another round? Okay.

647
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,422
Thanks.

648
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:34,302
So we've got what,
another 20 minutes?

649
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:35,720
More or less.

650
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:42,519
That fettuccine is sitting
in my stomach like a rock.

651
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:46,440
You got nothing to worry about.
I put Imodium in Toby's coffee

652
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,150
before the race.

653
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,735
Excellent!

654
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,987
Simpsons.

655
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,781
Wait, Imodium
or Ex-Lax?

656
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,076
I'm making great time.

657
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,328
Usually, I'd have to take a bathroom
break halfway through a race like this,

658
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:02,914
but not today.

659
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,670
An estate sale.
Want to go in?

660
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,465
I don't know. I'm really
committed to winning.

661
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,968
Okay, but what if I told you
that all the money you spend here

662
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,803
goes to preventing a disease
that's already been cured?

663
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,221
Yes. That's what I thought.

664
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,556
Yeah.
Right?

665
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,809
Let's do some good.

666
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,979
You have reached the offices

667
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,188
of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

668
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,815
Currently,
the entire staff is out

669
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:32,398
doing the Michael Scott DMSMPMC
Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race.

670
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,738
For the cure.

671
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,948
Leave a message.

672
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,246
Oh, God.
Alfredo sauce.

673
00:34:43,497 --> 00:34:44,664
I'm getting a stitch.

674
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,213
God! Watch the nipples, Kevin!

675
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,048
Back off me.

676
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,466
How are you feeling?
Better?

677
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,717
No.

678
00:34:55,801 --> 00:34:58,887
Well, you look cute as a button.
You've worked up quite a sweat.

679
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,306
The vet is removing all of
Sprinkles' organs right now

680
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,225
and sending them
to the lab.

681
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,102
I am a farmer, Angela.

682
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:06,227
What does
that mean?

683
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,188
Okay, when a farmer sees
an animal that is in pain,

684
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,024
that has no quality of
life, that has no utility,

685
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:14,528
a farmer does what city folk
don't have the stomach to do.

686
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:17,113
You did kill her?

687
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:19,824
I sang her
her favorite songs.

688
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,326
You put her
in my freezer.

689
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,662
It was beautiful and
gentle and respectful.

690
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,331
I fed her antihistamines
and she gradually fell asleep.

691
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,834
Well, then, she barfed them up
in the freezer and tried to get out.

692
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,293
Well, I'm not
responsible for that! Get!

693
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:31,711
Hey!

694
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,797
It's okay.
It's nothing!

695
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:34,965
I'm robbing her.

696
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,341
It's nothing! It's
nothing! It's fine!

697
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,426
What?

698
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:39,344
How could you do that
without telling me?

699
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,472
I thought I was helping
you. I expected a hug.

700
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:46,393
I took care of that cat
the best way I knew how.

701
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,604
Cat heaven is
a beautiful place,

702
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:52,023
but you don't get there
if you're euthanized.

703
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,611
I know a great taxidermist.
I'll pay to have her stuffed.

704
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:57,779
Well, he's not great,
but he's pretty good.

705
00:35:57,863 --> 00:35:59,656
You don't understand.

706
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,242
Take bat bites seriously.
Don't get bit.

707
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,956
Or we can have her buried
out at the east field, by mother.

708
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,709
Huh?
Angela?

709
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,794
Don't touch me,
Dwight.

710
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:26,099
You like it? It's kind
of designy and cool.

711
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,517
It was $8.

712
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,103
Oh, and
I get to carry it.

713
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:47,245
And the winner
is Toby Flenderson.

714
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,874
Have a seat.
I'll write it down.

715
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,797
Where are we?

716
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,757
I don't know, like five
kilometers from the office.

717
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,595
He couldn't have
made it a circle?

718
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,730
I am not
going to finish.

719
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,235
I can't beat rabies.

720
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:20,320
Nobody can beat rabies.

721
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,365
Rabies has been around
for a thousand years

722
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,118
and I was a fool to
think that I could beat it.

723
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:34,084
Yeah, probably.
Hey.

724
00:37:35,961 --> 00:37:37,045
Michael?

725
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,341
What are you doing here?
Did you come back for us?

726
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,926
I can't finish.

727
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,679
I feel so weak.
I just...

728
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,055
Well, you're probably
dehydrated.

729
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,723
What do you want
me to do, Jim?

730
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:49,974
Glass of water
would be a start.

731
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:53,061
No.
There are people

732
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:57,645
all over the world with all sorts of
problems and afflictions and diseases.

733
00:37:58,108 --> 00:37:59,901
They're deformed

734
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,363
and they're abnormal and

735
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,491
they're illiterate
and ugly.

736
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,702
Symphonies don't
have any money.

737
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,996
Public TV is bust.

738
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:13,915
I can't do anything about
it. I can't, you Know...

739
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,835
There's just one of me.

740
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,546
And there's
a thousand of them.

741
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:22,048
And rabies wins.

742
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,592
Wow!
You are a downer.

743
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,137
We were having
a pretty nice day.

744
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,472
I'm still having
a nice day.

745
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:30,473
You are?
Yeah.

746
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:34,519
Hey, Michael, look
at this lamp. $8.

747
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,271
That's a good deal.

748
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:40,692
And Michael,
you don't have rabies,

749
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,154
and chances are you're not
going to get it anytime soon.

750
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,491
So, you don't really have
to think about it too much.

751
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:51,536
Pam, if everybody felt that
way, nothing would get done.

752
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:57,204
Yeah, but there's other, better
people out there who are helping.

753
00:38:57,709 --> 00:39:02,046
You just don't think I am
capable of making a difference.

754
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:06,593
I know you, Michael.
I saw you naked.

755
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,762
You don't...

756
00:39:09,596 --> 00:39:11,347
You don't know me.

757
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,643
You've just seen my penis.
I can make a difference.

758
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:17,937
Remember, I'm the one
who started this whole thing off

759
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,981
by hitting Meredith
with my car.

760
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:25,024
And I owe it to her
to finish this GD 5K.

761
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,743
No! No!

762
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:49,673
Finishing that 5K was
the hardest thing I have ever had to do.

763
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:58,144
I ate more fettuccine
Alfredo and drank less water

764
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:00,313
than I have in
my entire life.

765
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,068
People always talk about
triumphs of the human spirit.

766
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:09,652
Well, today, I had a
triumph of the human body.

767
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,826
That's why everybody was
applauding for me at the end,

768
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,703
my guts and my heart.

769
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:21,335
And while I eventually
puked my guts out, I never

770
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,796
puked my heart out.

771
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:27,882
I'm very,
very proud of that.

772
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,178
Hey, Michael.

773
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:33,388
Hey, Mere.

774
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,891
How are you doing?
Better.

775
00:40:35,974 --> 00:40:37,558
It's ironic,
isn't it?

776
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:40,270
I mean, I'm in the hospital
for not getting enough water

777
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,774
and you're in it for a disease
that causes a fear of water.

778
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:46,985
I'm in because you
hit me with your car.

779
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:51,990
But I want to say, I heard
you were trying really hard, so

780
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,659
I'm not mad
at you anymore.

781
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,619
Thanks.

782
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,706
I'm not mad
at you anymore.

783
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,798
Want to share?

784
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,009
Sure.

785
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,427
I'm not really sick.

786
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,936
No, I'm good.
