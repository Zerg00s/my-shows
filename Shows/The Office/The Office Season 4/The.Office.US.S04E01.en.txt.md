# Episode 4x01 "FUN RUN"


**Trivia**
- In May of 2007, Jenna Fischer fell down a flight of stairs and fractured her back. When filming for season 4 began, she had healed considerably, but was still not allowed to run. This is why Pam & Jim do not run the 5K.

- Angela Kinsey (Angela) was pregnant during the filming of most of season 4, that's why the cameras never show her stomach.

- Filming the run was not easy for the cast. On John Krasinski's YouTube series Some Good News (2020), he and Steve Carell commented on how the temperature that day was a sweltering 105 degrees.

- The scene where Angela talks to Pam about her suspicion that Dwight killed her cat took a long time to shoot because Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey, who are good friends in real life, couldn't keep a straight face when talking to each other. It was so bad that they stopped shooting the scene and the director told them both to take a break while the director filmed something else and they came back to it later in the day.

- The full name of the titular Fun Run is "Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Fun Run Pro Am Race for the Cure."

- In the scene when Jim and Pam leave the Dunder Mifflin parking lot they pass a for rent sign that has an 818 area code. 818 is the area code for the San Fernando Valley, not Scranton PA. Also all the cars on the street have California license plates.
