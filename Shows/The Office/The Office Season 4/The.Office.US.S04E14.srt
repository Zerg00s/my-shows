1
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:10,009
W.B. Jones is renovating their
offices, and their construction crews

2
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:12,762
are taking up some of the
parking spaces we used to get.

3
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,640
So we had to park at a
satellite parking lot over there.

4
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,351
Which just means we get to
see more of our lovely street.

5
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,977
Tell them what
we saw today, Jim.

6
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:25,066
Oh, today we saw a junkyard dog attacking
the bones of a rotisserie chicken.

7
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,275
Nature.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,693
I've been here
nine years,

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,862
now all of a sudden I'm
supposed to park half a mile away.

10
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,908
I lost a penny out
of my loafers, Oscar.

11
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,535
I will quit.

12
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:39,497
As God is my witness, I
will quit if this is not fixed.

13
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:41,958
Some of us like the walk
more than others.

14
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,085
It hurts like hell.

15
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,737
Did you pick a new chair?
It's been a while.

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,740
Pam, when I first
opened this catalogue,

17
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,285
I thought I was just going
to be picking out a chair.

18
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,830
But instead you found something to
distract you from ever picking out a chair.

19
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,625
Michael started the process of selecting
a new chair about three weeks ago.

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,461
And normally I wouldn't care,
but he promised me his old one.

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,630
It's way better.
It's one of these.

22
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,009
I really want it.

23
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,304
Have you ever
seen this woman?

24
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,555
Her?

25
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:40,933
The one in the really great mesh,
black, high-back swivel chair?

26
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,021
Look at her smile. It's the eyes.
Look at her eyes. She's got...

27
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:49,609
I don't know what it is, exactly.
She dresses like a professional,

28
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:54,822
and yet you know there is a side of
her that could just curl up on a couch.

29
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:56,282
Orin a great chair.

30
00:01:56,365 --> 00:01:58,367
Yeah, maybe, but...

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,956
Remember, after my dinner party,
when I said that I was swearing off women?

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,958
I definitely remember
your dinner party.

33
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,378
I think what I meant was that I am
completely swearing off one woman.

34
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:11,589
Jan.

35
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,302
I think that fate put this
catalogue in my hands.

36
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:19,639
Actually, I put the catalogue in your hand,
"cause you have to pick out a new chair.

37
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:24,727
What is it like being single?
I like it. I like

38
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,981
starting each day with
a sense of possibility.

39
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,566
And I'm optimistic,

40
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,736
because every day I get
a little more desperate,

41
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:37,281
and desperate situations
yield the quickest results.

42
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,076
Ladies and gentlemen, would you
please open your supply catalogues

43
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,286
and kindly turn
to Page 857

44
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,042
Yo, is this
his new chair?

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,627
No, he hasn't
picked one yet.

46
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,836
God!

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,507
When Pam gets Michael's
old chair, I get Pam's old chair.

48
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,302
Then I'll have two chairs.
Only one to go.

49
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:03,516
I am ready to start dating again.
I'm getting back on the market.

50
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,646
So, FYI, for those of you
who're thinking about fixing me up

51
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,439
with any of your friends,

52
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,859
use the woman
on Page 85

53
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,611
as a template.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,363
That will be all.

55
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:27,373
I left my cell phone
in my car.

56
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,627
Call us when you get there,
so we know you're okay.

57
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,884
Listen, man, I am
completely over Jan.

58
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,263
So, would you
set me up?

59
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:46,976
If I had somebody to set you up with,
Michael, then I'd take her for myself.

60
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,102
I thought you
were engaged.

61
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,813
Nope. Stacy broke up
with me.

62
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,317
What? God,
that's terrible, man.

63
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,195
She's crazy.

64
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you still on good terms
with any of her friends?

65
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,493
Not anymore.
It's a bitter situation.

66
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:09,582
She's...
You don't deserve her.

67
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,708
All right.

68
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,171
Hello, Oscar Mayer
Weiner lover.

69
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:21,343
I bet that you have a bunch
of very liberal girl-type friends

70
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,471
who trust you implicitly,

71
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,348
because they know you'd never
touch "em because of your condition.

72
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,976
Michael?
What?

73
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:31,270
I have a friend
who's single.

74
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:32,480
Sandy.

75
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:36,942
She's gorgeous, and she's
got a feisty personality, too.

76
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:42,573
Feisty? So she's not jolly or sassy?
Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?

77
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,909
No, she's a professional
softball player.

78
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,120
Catcher or infield?

79
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,497
I don't know, Michael.

80
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,335
Is she a dress-wearer
or a pants-wearer?

81
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,880
Could we share a rowboat?
Could a rowboat support her?

82
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:58,964
What are you asking?

83
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,300
I think I'm being very
clear what I'm asking.

84
00:05:01,383 --> 00:05:05,262
Would an average-sized rowboat
support her without capsizing?

85
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,143
It bothers me that you're
not answering the question.

86
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,562
No, all right? No,
she can't fit in a rowboat.

87
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,773
Damn it! I knew it!
I knew it, Phyllis! Okay.

88
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:19,026
What is wrong with these people?
I would do anything for them,

89
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,903
and they're just
hanging me out to dry.

90
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:22,988
Dating shouldn't be hard
for somebody like me,

91
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:28,035
but it is, and you know why? Because
nobody here is willing to help me.

92
00:05:29,578 --> 00:05:33,290
Nothing would ever get done in this
office without a formal request, would it?

93
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,668
Well, fine.
Here goes.

94
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,002
I don't think that
this is... Now, okay,

95
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,005
I know that this is
probably not appropriate.

96
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,508
But I need help.

97
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:50,307
Because I want to play ball
with my kids before I get too old.

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,311
And before that happens,
I need to get laid.

99
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,858
And before that happens,
I need to be in love.

100
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,444
And I don't wanna hear, "I
don't know, I can't help..."

101
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,906
No, no. I am a catch,
and I am not going to be

102
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,241
the one who got away.

103
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,702
So this is what
we're going to do.

104
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:14,957
Dwight is going to hand out index cards,
and I want you all to write down the name

105
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,961
of an eligible woman for me
to date by the end of the day.

106
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,465
No, by the end of the hour,
or you are fired.

107
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:27,803
Write legibly, people.

108
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:34,184
Because of the construction at W.B. Jones,
half of us have to park in the satellite lot.

109
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,186
It's, like, a ten-minute
walk. No, 30.

110
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,940
Well, look, I have an assigned
parking place in front, so...

111
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:42,902
All right, all right,
all right.

112
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:46,989
Let me try to think about what
it would be like to not have one.

113
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:56,248
Okay, yes, that
would be bad. Yes!

114
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,417
That would be bad.
Okay, so...

115
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,253
Help us out. Wish
I could, but I can't.

116
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,130
Well, can, but won't.

117
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,591
Should, maybe,
but, shorn't.

118
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:06,842
Michael, please...

119
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,595
What part of "shorn't"
don't you understand, Kevin?

120
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:12,514
Look, I could probably
handle it, yes, but...

121
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,392
I think it would be a good exercise
for you guys to do it yourselves.

122
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,686
We won't let you down. You
can't, because I don't care.

123
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:22,900
Listen! Don't forget to fill out
those cards. My love cards.

124
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,488
There's nobody I hate enough
to write her name on this card.

125
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:30,824
Well, I'm setting Michael up
with my fat friend, anyway.

126
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,701
He can just
deal with it.

127
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,911
Who are you
putting down?

128
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,245
Oh, you don't know her.

129
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,414
Who is it?
Your mom.

130
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,083
Yeah, whatever.

131
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,378
Give that to me!
Give that to me.

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,546
Okay, Wendy.

133
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,840
Hot and juicy redhead.

134
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,093
Let's give this a try.

135
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,351
Wendy's.

136
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,186
Hello, Wendy.

137
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,647
This is Kevin's friend,
Michael.

138
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,649
This isn't Wendy.

139
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,526
I'm sorry. Could you
put her on, please?

140
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,653
Dude, this is a
Wendy's restaurant.

141
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,156
Damn it, Kevin. Okay...

142
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,241
Um...

143
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,953
Could I just have a Frosty
and a baked potato, please?

144
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,788
You have to come to the
restaurant to order food.

145
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,957
Well, I'll send somebody to
pick it up, just have it ready.

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,417
It's ready now.

147
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,626
Well, put it aside.

148
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,130
Um...

149
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,881
I've collected the rest
of the ladies.

150
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,258
Good, good.

151
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,468
Because this batch
was awful.

152
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,804
This one says
"chair model"?

153
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,222
I wrote that.

154
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:40,394
Michael, you shouldn't have to
settle. This is my pledge to you.

155
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:43,647
I will find her, and I
will bring her to you.

156
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,067
And as God is my witness,
she shall bear your fruit.

157
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,489
That sounds good.
Go get her.

158
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,533
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!

159
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:58,203
First, go to Wendy's, get my
food, come back, and then go.

160
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,498
That is fantastic.

161
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:05,002
Thank you, thank you very
much. This is just what I needed.

162
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:08,130
The furniture company gave me
the name of the advertising agency.

163
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,257
They gave me the name
of the photographer.

164
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,595
The photographer, a Spaniard,
used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency.

165
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:17,431
The agency gave me
the following information.

166
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:20,559
Deborah Shoshlefski,
142 South Windsor Lane.

167
00:09:20,642 --> 00:09:23,020
Dead, car accident.
Case closed.

168
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,731
She's dead?

169
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,611
But she's so young. She was
so young, and now, she is dead.

170
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:33,697
As dead as every dead animal
who has ever died.

171
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,200
God.

172
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:43,123
Why don't you sit down,
Michael? Come on.

173
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,710
There we go.

174
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:54,551
Michael, you didn't
even know her.

175
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,054
Try not to be
so hurtful, Jim.

176
00:09:57,137 --> 00:10:00,432
Jim, how dare you?
Please, not at a time like this.

177
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,065
Okay, Michael, you know what?
I might have someone for you.

178
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:11,235
Oh, really? What's her
name? Burger King?

179
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:12,653
No, I mean it.

180
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:19,827
She's really nice and sweet and
you guys might actually get along.

181
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,539
I don't think I'm ready.
Is she hot?

182
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:28,293
I'm setting Michael up with my
landlady. She's really sweet, and...

183
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,839
Whatever, I just can't
take Michael like this.

184
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,259
No question about it,
I am ready to get hurt again.

185
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,928
We need to assemble
the Five Families.

186
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,346
No, not the
Five Families.

187
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:40,556
We have to!

188
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,018
The Five Families are the five
companies of Scranton Business Park.

189
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,937
The bosses rarely meet.

190
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,857
There's Michael Scott,
Regional Manager, Dunder Mifflin.

191
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,651
Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

192
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,946
Paul Faust
of Disaster Kits Limited.

193
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,865
They call him "Cool Guy" Paul.

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,577
W.B. Jones of
W.B. Jones Heating and Air.

195
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,620
Grade A badass.

196
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:08,959
And Bill Cress of Cress Tool and Die.
Bill Cress is super old and really mean.

197
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,962
Kevin, I don't have time
for this right now.

198
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm trying to get a date
with Pam's hot friend.

199
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,634
And she needs
to meet me right now.

200
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,639
I'm calling
the meeting anyway.

201
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,393
Thank you very much.

202
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:32,524
Our suspect has straight brown hair.
She is wearing blue jeans and a black top.

203
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,401
So...

204
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,280
Behold our bachelorette.

205
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:42,701
Give her a 10 for her looks, and a
three for her ability to describe herself.

206
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,662
Hello, my lady.

207
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,543
Michael?

208
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,045
Uh...

209
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,797
Are you Michael Scott?

210
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,591
Is who Michael what?

211
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:01,178
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be
meeting someone named Michael.

212
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:04,223
That's not... Yeah,
I'm not... Michael?

213
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,267
Michael?

214
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,021
Large hot chocolate with
caramel and a shot of peppermint.

215
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,236
So you

216
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,240
get the rent checks
every month, and...

217
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,785
What happens next? What...

218
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,250
You're asking me what I do with
the checks that people write to me?

219
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,336
Just making
conversation.

220
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:37,381
Why is it so hard to meet
people? I... You know, it's...

221
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:43,011
All want is somebody
nice, and sweet,

222
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:49,059
and someone I can talk to and
share an experience with, you know?

223
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,813
Why is it so hard
for people like us?

224
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:55,023
I don't know.

225
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,446
You want to see
what I walked out on?

226
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,283
This is going to blow
your mind. Look at that!

227
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,369
She's beautiful.
Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:11,039
And you can't see her whole
body, down here, she has a boob job.

229
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,708
Just...

230
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:17,421
She was just crazy smart
and really manipulative, and...

231
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:18,588
I don't know.

232
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,967
Michael?
Hello, Michael?

233
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,221
Well, I'm gonna head out.

234
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,639
Oh, okay.

235
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,893
Well, I enjoyed
this conversation.

236
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,313
It was very nice.

237
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,318
It was like talking to the
sweet, old lady on the bus.

238
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,865
That's incredibly rude.

239
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,450
Now you ruined it.

240
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,203
Where's Scott?

241
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,749
Michael Scott could not make it today
due to an unforeseen prior engagement.

242
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,250
Let's just meet
back in an hour.

243
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,127
Gentlemen, please.

244
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,339
We called
this meeting.

245
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,800
Andrew Bernard

246
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:07,763
is the name of me, and this is
my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.

247
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:09,639
I have things.

248
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,266
All right,
what do you want?

249
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,978
Well, first of all, I'd just
like to say what an honor it is

250
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,606
to be sitting here with you
gentlemen. You have about 10 seconds.

251
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,816
We want our parking
spaces back.

252
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,568
Whose parking spaces?

253
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:26,198
W.B. Jones' construction guys park
in our parking spaces every morning,

254
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,701
and some people have
to park really far away

255
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,536
and walk all the way
to the office.

256
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:35,040
And some people sweat
too much for comfort, and...

257
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,249
My God.

258
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,462
I don't have time for this, guys.
Just give them back their spaces.

259
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,714
Okay.
We good? Okay.

260
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,884
Could've done this
over e-mail.

261
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:54,559
After Stacy left, things
did not go well for a while.

262
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:56,978
And it was hard to see...

263
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,776
It's just nice
to win one.

264
00:15:06,613 --> 00:15:09,783
Margaret the landlady? Really,
Pam? Is that what you think of me?

265
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:13,245
She's sweet and cute.
I thought you would get along.

266
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:18,542
Oh, okay. Well, I'm looking for a
passionate affair, not companionship.

267
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,086
I'm a man of intensity.

268
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,756
Of cool, and youth,

269
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,801
and passionately. God...

270
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,018
Margaret?
I know...

271
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,020
You just got yourself
kicked out of your apartment.

272
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,191
Oh, I don't care. I didn't really
like that place that much, anyway.

273
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,317
I'll just move.

274
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,444
Oh, really?

275
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:50,240
Who's gonna take you in? You're messy.
You're a klutz, you spill everything.

276
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,994
And you leave the volume
on the TV way too loud.

277
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:55,620
Yeah.

278
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,249
Maybe I'll just move in with my
boyfriend, 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.

279
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:02,252
Okay. Sure.
Let's do it.

280
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,299
No, I... Well, I'm
not gonna... I'm...

281
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,385
I'm not gonna move in with
anyone unless I'm engaged.

282
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,346
Have I not proposed
to you yet?

283
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,683
I don't... No.
Oh.

284
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:19,769
Well, that's coming.

285
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,188
Oh, right now?

286
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:25,942
No. I'm not gonna do it right
here. That would be rather lame.

287
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,903
Okay, so then when?

288
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:29,279
Pam, I'm not
gonna tell you.

289
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,198
I hate to break it to you,
but that's not how that works.

290
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,283
Oh, right. Yeah.

291
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:34,951
Wait, I'm serious.

292
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,536
It's happening.
Okay.

293
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:40,624
And when it happens, it's
going to kick your ass, Beesly.

294
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,960
So, stay sharp.

295
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,253
I've been warned.

296
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,176
I am not kidding.

297
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,935
Got it a week after
we started dating.

298
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,440
I don't know, man. I
was with Jan for so long...

299
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,779
I was excited about meeting
somebody new. Put my heart out there.

300
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,369
You know what
you need?

301
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:19,704
Closure.

302
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:21,998
You're right.

303
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,377
What do you mean, though?

304
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,548
There was a woman in your life
who affected you very deeply,

305
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:34,261
and she left before you could say
goodbye. I think you need to say goodbye.

306
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:37,722
Hmm.

307
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,100
Come on.
I'll drive.

308
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,061
We did it!
I did it.

309
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:45,063
We got our
spaces back.

310
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:49,109
Nice job.

311
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,360
Nice.
Yeah.

312
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,279
There it is.
You're welcome.

313
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,824
Did I do this
for me? No.

314
00:17:55,907 --> 00:18:00,078
I did this for the little guy.
For Joe Six-Pack,

315
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:03,123
the guy who wakes up every
morning in his $400-a-month apartment,

316
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,543
wonders how he's gonna
pay his mortgage that month.

317
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:09,713
Wonders how he's gonna
fill his car up with oil.

318
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:13,508
Wonders, "How am I going to
pay my kids' orphanage bills?"

319
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,638
That guy shouldn't have to
wonder where he's gonna park.

320
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,782
How did she die?

321
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,870
I guess you could say
she died of

322
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,582
blunt-force trauma
and blood loss.

323
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:49,252
She got in a car accident and plowed
into the side of an airplane hangar.

324
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,879
God...
Yeah.

325
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,631
She was so innocent.

326
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,591
She was stoned,
apparently.

327
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,261
You know,
I used to think that

328
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,598
I had this perfect person
out there, waiting for me.

329
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:04,351
But now I know
that that's just silly.

330
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,394
Because she's dead.

331
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,689
What do you do?

332
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:13,693
You wait till next year's
chair catalogue comes out,

333
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,738
and you find someone
who's still alive.

334
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,823
You move on.
Yeah.

335
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,784
Where do you want
to go for dinner?

336
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:24,621
I don't know. I kind of hate
all our regular places right now.

337
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,539
Oh!

338
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,833
You know what?
That one...

339
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,253
Hey, Pam?

340
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,676
Will you wait for me one
second while I tie my shoe?

341
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,470
I hate you.
What?

342
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:44,140
My shoe is untied.
What is your problem?

343
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,810
Oh, my God!
You thought I...

344
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,645
No, no, no. How could
I have thought that?

345
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,188
How could I have
thought that?

346
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,613
Bye, bye

347
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,199
Miss chair model lady

348
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,206
I dreamt that we were married
and you treated me nice

349
00:20:08,998 --> 00:20:11,751
We had lots of kids

350
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,672
Drinking whiskey and rye

351
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,301
But why'd you have
to go off and die?

352
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:26,182
Why'd you have
to go off and die?

353
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,480
You believe in rock 'n' roll?

354
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:36,234
Can music save
your mortal soul?

355
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,112
And then, can you
have to dance

356
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,699
real slow?

357
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:46,077
Well, I know
that you're in love with him

358
00:20:46,202 --> 00:20:49,497
"Cause I saw you
dancing in the gym

359
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,459
Kicked off their shoes They
both turned off their shoes

360
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,546
No more rhythm and blues!
No verdict was returned!

361
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,882
Rhythm and blues

362
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:05,430
This will be the day
that I die
