1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,843
What's wrong, Michael?

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,595
I got gum in my hair.

3
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:13,679
You do.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,057
This just stinks.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,683
Don't touch it.
Please, don't touch it!

6
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:18,768
You've got a ton
of dandruff.

7
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:19,894
Okay, let me be.

8
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:21,062
How'd you get
gum in your hair?

9
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,689
I was walking in and I noticed
something shiny under Stanley's car,

10
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:28,027
and I'd gotten under to see what
it was, and I messed up my hair.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,154
All for a stupid
piece of tin foil.

12
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,490
But, best-case scenario,
you thought it was a quarter.

13
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,033
Kill me, right now.

14
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:36,327
We have peanut butter
in the kitchen.

15
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,163
I don't feel like peanut butter.
Get me an ice cream sandwich.

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,625
Nope, not for you, it's for
your hair. And it is 9:00 a.m.

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,212
No, Dwight, not the good peanut
butter. People are gonna get mad.

18
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:49,006
Hey, hey, hey. This is
my hair we're talking about.

19
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,927
Smells good.

20
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,221
Tastes good, too.

21
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,181
Oh, don't, that's disgusting.

22
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,933
Wow, a lot of calories.

23
00:00:59,016 --> 00:01:01,310
Well, just don't
leave it on too long.

24
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,771
Keep massaging, please.

25
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,274
Oh, yeah, that's nice.

26
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:44,562
Hey, Michael, how
was your date last night?

27
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,025
I will be honest. The dating
has not been going well.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,695
Look, men are
visual creatures.

29
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:59,577
We crave beauty. Like
a piece of fine art by

30
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,873
any number of
renowned artists.

31
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:09,629
Or an arty photograph
of Cindy Crawford nude.

32
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:13,132
That, but the women I'm
getting fixed up with are...

33
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:19,347
Not that they aren't nice
or have great personalities,

34
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,476
they just, they just lack
a certain Crawfordness.

35
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:27,188
I am livid.
Absolutely livid.

36
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,356
It's ridiculous.

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,067
Yes, I'm having the Scranton
branch come in on one Saturday,

38
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,569
so they can re-enter sales
that they made on the phone

39
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,822
as sales made by the website, which
they should've done in the first place,

40
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,449
if the website had
been working.

41
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:44,664
My favorite branch.
How's everybody doing?

42
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,999
Hey, man, do you mind
if I run something by you?

43
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,043
Love it! Go.

44
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:53,214
Well, I kind of feel like what we have
going for us IS our customer service.

45
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:55,591
And no matter how much
we change this up,

46
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,302
I don't know that a website's
gonna be able to replace that.

47
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,513
I can tell you've thought
about this a lot. I appreciate that.

48
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,597
Thanks.

49
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,807
David Wallace does, too.

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,060
You told him all about this
at the Christmas party, right?

51
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:08,854
Did 1?

52
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,106
You did, yeah.

53
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,190
Hmm.

54
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:13,401
Watch your back, Jim.

55
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:16,529
I'm just kidding.

56
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,785
Ladies and gentlemen, may
I have your attention, please?

57
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,079
I know that a lot of you
are very angry with Ryan,

58
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,206
because he is the reason we
all have to come in tomorrow.

59
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:32,294
However, I swear to God, if
any of you hurts him in any way

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,505
emotionally, or taunts him,

61
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:38,175
or makes fun of his
height or his half-beard...

62
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,511
Okay. Thanks,
Michael. He... Yeah.

63
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:41,762
I'm here today

64
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,807
to do some creative problem
solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity

65
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,767
and field your
questions. Question.

66
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,852
Dwight.

67
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:48,978
Why am I being forced
to come in tomorrow

68
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,147
and pretend that a website
made sales that I made?

69
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,442
This is a temporary measure to
increase the legitimacy of the site.

70
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,153
I don't like when my clients call
me to help them use the website.

71
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,863
I'm not seeing
commissions on that.

72
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,449
I hear you, Stanley. That
is a great observation.

73
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:06,245
Problems like that will not happen
when we launch Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0.

74
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,164
When will that be?
TBD.

75
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,248
Phyllis.

76
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,374
Did the police solve
the problem with...

77
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,752
Yes, yes, they did.
Yes, they did.

78
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,006
Yes, the social networking feature
of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website

79
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,592
was infiltrated by
sexual predators.

80
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,595
I don't understand why our website
needs to have social networking at all.

81
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:24,555
Yeah, actually I have to
agree with Dwight on that one.

82
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:28,142
It's all about creating a
one-stop consumer experience.

83
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:30,144
All right? You're chatting
with your friends,

84
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:31,979
you're talking about
the latest music.

85
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,105
About the election.

86
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:37,401
All of it is happening
in our virtual paper store.

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,029
And then an older gentleman
asks you, "Boxers or briefs?"

88
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:42,490
I don't get the big fuss,
here. I like the site.

89
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,785
If I had created a website with
this many problems, I'd kill myself.

90
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,869
Do you have a
question, Kelly?

91
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,078
Yeah, I have a
lot of questions.

92
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,080
Number one.
How dare you?

93
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:59,173
Ryan has done a very good job,
and I am not applauding sarcastically.

94
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,925
Think about it.
A month ago,

95
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,260
nobody would go on this
site, because we were worried

96
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,723
about getting molested or
losing our identity, having it stolen.

97
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:14,355
But now, at a time TDB, all of
these problems will be in the past.

98
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,899
You done good, kid.
You done good.

99
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,781
Well, it has been nice
seeing you again, my friend.

100
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:24,907
You, too.

101
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,203
Oh, Ryan, I need a
girlfriend so bad.

102
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:30,788
Michael, let me go.

103
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:32,039
Let me go, Michael.

104
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,207
All right.

105
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,919
Do you know any girls in New York
you might want to hook me up with,

106
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,922
that might be interested
in a guy like me?

107
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,674
Nah.
Nah.

108
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,342
Sorry, man.
Well, you tried.

109
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,885
But, seriously...

110
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,680
You should see the girls
I meet at clubs in the city.

111
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:48,806
Unreal.

112
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,266
They sound great.

113
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,895
Bye, everyone! Stay real,
Scranton, all right? Peace!

114
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,899
Would you have sex
with Meredith?

115
00:05:58,983 --> 00:05:59,984
What?

116
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,235
Do you think
she'd keep it quiet?

117
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:02,903
I'm gonna go to my desk.

118
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,824
Jim, it's not the horniness,
okay? It's the loneliness. That's...

119
00:06:07,157 --> 00:06:08,200
I know.

120
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,744
Let's go to New York.
We'll go clubbing with Ryan.

121
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,079
I can't.
Yes, you can.

122
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:13,914
You're single, I'm single.
It'll be awesome.

123
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm not single.

124
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,625
Who are you dating?

125
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,252
Pam.

126
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,879
That's still going on?

127
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:25,009
Okay, Dwight, grab your stuff.

128
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,678
We're going to New York to
party with Ryan and to meet girls.

129
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:28,846
- Yeah!
- Oh, yes.

130
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:33,100
Count me in, dudes. I am in
serious need of some bro time.

131
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,187
Old ball and chain's been a
lot more chain than ball lately,

132
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,939
if you know what I'm
saying. I'm right here.

133
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,526
No, singles only. Singles
only. Also, three is unlucky.

134
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,195
Curse of three.
Sorry, Andy.

135
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,531
Cannot take any chances
on curses. Not tonight.

136
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,284
Let's go. Everybody, I will see
you tomorrow, Saturday morning,

137
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,662
probably wearing the same
clothes that I'm wearing right now,

138
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,956
if you catch my drift.

139
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,166
We get it.

140
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,751
I am going

141
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,461
to go get laid.

142
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,545
Goodbye!

143
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,255
With sex!

144
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,636
You know what? If we all
stayed a couple hours late tonight

145
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,889
without Michael distracting us, we
wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.

146
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:17,144
So I caught everyone before
they left, and I told them my idea.

147
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,562
And they loved it.

148
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,398
Because this is a group
that respects good ideas.

149
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,193
The one time a year
they hear one.

150
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,448
Ryan's assistant told us

151
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:32,493
that he would be
at this club this evening.

152
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,203
It is called Prerogative.

153
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,417
This place is packed!

154
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,002
Fire hazard.

155
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,462
Packed with

156
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,172
"beautiful babies."

157
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,800
Swingers, classic.

158
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:51,929
Jon Favreau,
tall guy from Dodgeball.

159
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,223
These women look
like white slaves.

160
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,517
No, they're just hot.
Hotties.

161
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,812
I don't know. When you think about
it, Cabo is really the Third World.

162
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:02,481
I don't go to a place like
that to see more poverty, you know?

163
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,607
You go there to get
some glamour, and...

164
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,692
Hey.

165
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,776
Michael?

166
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:06,860
Hey.

167
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:07,945
What are you doing here?

168
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,071
Well, you know,

169
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,990
just taking you up
on your offer to party, so...

170
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,074
Ta-da!

171
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,784
That is so awesome, man!

172
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,077
All right!

173
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,620
And you brought this guy!

174
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,955
Yeah!

175
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:19,289
Oh!

176
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,710
Ryan, it's Michael
and Dwight.

177
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,169
I know it's you guys!
Okay.

178
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,171
I'm so psyched
you're here. Well...

179
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,507
All right!

180
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:30,175
Let's get a drink!

181
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,260
Let's do it!

182
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,936
Thanks a lot, guys!
Good job!

183
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:44,940
Later.

184
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,525
Nice job, everybody.

185
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,735
Great work.

186
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:57,202
Did you not tell the security
guard we were working late?

187
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:59,872
Nope. I didn't.

188
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,542
But let's go inside and
I can call him right now.

189
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,545
We can't. I locked the office
from the inside when we left.

190
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,173
Perfect. You guys worked
together on this one.

191
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:13,761
If I'm not in my bath with a glass of
red wine in one hour, you're both dead.

192
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:21,393
There is a master key and
a spare key for the office.

193
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,687
Dwight has them both.

194
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,941
When I asked, "What if you die,
Dwight? How will we get into the office?"

195
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,445
He said, "If I'm dead, you
guys have been dead for weeks."

196
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,407
Guys, I want you to meet a
really good friend of mine. This is Troy.

197
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,533
Hey,
nice to meet you.

198
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,659
How're you doing?

199
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,036
Hi. Dwight.

200
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,538
You resemble the
Tolkien character.

201
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,583
He basically is, man. He's
a regular banking wizard.

202
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,794
No, no, no, not a wizard.
A hobbit.

203
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,129
Bottle service, y'all?

204
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,590
Oh, okay.
All I know is,

205
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:54,843
I would like some chicken
fingers and a Midori Sour.

206
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,678
We don't serve food here.

207
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,807
Oh, okay. Then just
bring me two cups,

208
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,977
one with olives, and another
one filled with maraschino cherries.

209
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,981
Do you live in a
regular-sized house?

210
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,442
Yeah, he's a normal guy.
He's cool.

211
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,653
You really don't have
his phone number?

212
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:14,988
I told you, I have the
number that rings here.

213
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,156
Do you want that number?

214
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,950
I might have it in here.

215
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,910
Wow, that's great, Toby.

216
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,829
It's so random
that I have it.

217
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,413
Toby, you're the best!

218
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,792
When I put it in, I thought it might be a
waste of time, but I guess it was worth it.

219
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,253
Great. It's under here
as "security guard home."

220
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,213
Did you not get
his name, or... No.

221
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:33,549
It's ringing... Does anybody
have his name, quick?

222
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:34,675
Yes, it's Eddie.

223
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,802
It's not... It's not
Eddie. It's Evan or...

224
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:38,262
Hank.
His name is Hank.

225
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:41,014
No, guys, his name's
not Hank, it's... Is it Edgar?

226
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,099
Elliot.
Elliot.

227
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,143
Is it... Hey, chief.

228
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,979
This is Jim Halpert from

229
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,397
where you work.

230
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:52,943
You are the guy who sits
behind the desk. You're the...

231
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,487
The African-American guy.

232
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,072
I mean, you're...

233
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,991
Who have I got here?

234
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,619
Dwight Schrute, man.
How's Schrute Farms?

235
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,954
Good.

236
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,831
This guy owns
his own beet farm.

237
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:06,957
Insane!

238
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,084
Well, it's weevil season,
but we were prepared.

239
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,837
"Weevils."
What a crazy word, man.

240
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,423
I don't even know what that
means. What does that mean?

241
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,884
They lay their eggs
inside the unripe beetroot,

242
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,052
then, come springtime,
the babies eat their way out.

243
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,470
Crazy!
Sick!

244
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,974
That's too much for me, man.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom.

245
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:26,059
You've already been
several times.

246
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,144
Yeah?

247
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:28,812
Maybe you have some
kind of bladder infection.

248
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,938
I don't know. Maybe.

249
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,690
I'll order you some
cranberry juice.

250
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,567
With vodka.
You're the best!

251
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,737
Do you have powers?

252
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,530
Oh, thank you, Hank.

253
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,283
You are a lifesaver,
Hank. Appreciate it.

254
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:44,995
All right, so Hank is going to come
down here. He's gonna let us all out.

255
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,331
He said it should be
just under an hour, so...

256
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,665
Oh!

257
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,791
We did it.

258
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,669
We should all make sure to
give him a big tip this Christmas.

259
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,923
Sorry, guys, but I don't think
I chipped in for last year's.

260
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,257
Neither did I.

261
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,676
Jim was supposed
to collect it.

262
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,680
Way to go, man.

263
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,057
Now he's never
gonna come.

264
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,936
By a show of hands, who thinks
we're a better couple than Jim and Pam?

265
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,106
Phyllis!

266
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:19,112
I thought about getting a tattoo
on my back, as well, at one point.

267
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,199
I was thinking about getting
Back to the Future.

268
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,284
"Back" because
it's on my back,

269
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:29,039
and "Future" because I'm the kind of guy
who likes to look ahead into the future.

270
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,668
I just think a tattoo should
mean something, you know?

271
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,294
And it's my
second-favorite movie.

272
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,796
I've never heard
of that movie.

273
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:39,007
Back to the Future?
Oh, wow!

274
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,969
Well, you should take
a film education course.

275
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,303
How old are you?

276
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,305
40... I'm in my 40s.

277
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,517
Wow, that's so cool.

278
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,601
Yeah.

279
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,020
Well, I'm gonna go
back to my group now.

280
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,313
Oh, okay.

281
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,523
Thanks for the drink.

282
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,983
You are welcome.

283
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,615
This place is like a...
Like a sexy preschool.

284
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,575
Did you want a place where
we can meet older women?

285
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,036
I would love a place where
we can meet older girls.

286
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,246
Hell, yeah!

287
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,415
I'll hook it up!

288
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,667
Wow, that's dangerous.

289
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,343
Excuse me.

290
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,511
Yeah?

291
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,055
How did you all
find each other?

292
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:31,184
We're the Jersey State varsity basketball
team. Northeast Regional Champs.

293
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,063
Amazons!

294
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,233
It's Off. It's not
the dude I know.

295
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,402
It's some other loser who
won't let us in without chicks.

296
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:41,987
- You're kidding.
- Let's bail.

297
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,365
Wait, wait, wait. You two,
Jersey State girls, let's go.

298
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,326
We're not going
unless we can all go.

299
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,827
Okay, you know what? Fine.

300
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,246
Let's go, two girls to a
guy. Come on, let's do it.

301
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,914
Come on, Ryan. Move out!

302
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,209
Hey, three or four with him.
Let's go, come on. Here we go.

303
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,794
Don't step on him.

304
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:00,630
Really?

305
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,591
Hey, look what I
found in the back.

306
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,051
Want to play?
I can teach you to throw.

307
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,260
I know how to
throw a football.

308
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,470
Of course you do.

309
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:08,305
Yeah, Pam! Hit me up!

310
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,514
Go long!

311
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:17,606
There you go.

312
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,566
Wait a minute. What is
this? I didn't order this.

313
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,860
It's for you. From them.

314
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,200
What are you doing, man?

315
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:31,036
It's not safe. Anything
could have been in there.

316
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:32,496
Nice try!

317
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,623
I've never met anybody
who does that.

318
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,792
You wash dogs. Very cool.

319
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,419
That's one aspect of small
pet grooming. What do you do?

320
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,837
I am a bank teller.

321
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,508
Ryan told me to always tell
women you work in finance.

322
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,801
Cool. Yeah.

323
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,427
I think so.
Yeah, I have fun.

324
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,388
I'm just gonna use
the powder room.

325
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,056
All right. So, I'll
see you soon.

326
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,391
Very perfect.

327
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:03,193
This needs to be shared.

328
00:15:23,338 --> 00:15:25,048
She washes dogs.

329
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,466
You're doing it, man
I know!

330
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,052
I don't want to get ahead
of myself, but...

331
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,679
I think I want her
to meet my mom.

332
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,264
Hey, man,

333
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:35,392
do you ever think there's gonna
be this massive nuclear holocaust?

334
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,227
And after all the major
nations are destroyed,

335
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,147
there'll just be tribes in the
jungles that rise up and survive?

336
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,774
That jungle warfare
is gonna rule the world?

337
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,860
Yeah, maybe.

338
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,828
It's inevitable, right?

339
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:55,912
Mmm-hmm.

340
00:15:57,372 --> 00:15:58,790
Please don't pick up.
Please don't pick up.

341
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,875
Hello.

342
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,959
Hank.

343
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,502
Is that you?
Yeah.

344
00:16:03,503 --> 00:16:04,671
Still haven't left the
house yet, huh?

345
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,298
I was getting
ready to leave.

346
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,383
Good. Please hurry.

347
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:11,261
Stop calling me,
so I can put on my damn socks.

348
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,014
Will do. I'll stop calling.

349
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,143
I am.

350
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,895
I am getting out there.

351
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,064
Well, no, I've asked
a lot of girls to dance, Mom.

352
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,441
They're just... It's not...

353
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:26,860
Listen to me for a second.

354
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:30,530
Yes, I shaved
the back of my neck.

355
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,657
Oh, my God.
Mom, I gotta go.

356
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,743
One of my friends is getting
beaten up by some girls!

357
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:40,373
Actually, it's kind of too bad we're
not coming into work tomorrow.

358
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,583
Why?

359
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,876
I bet Michael had
some elaborate

360
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,129
theme party planned,
like "Scrambled Egg Saturday."

361
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,467
More like, "Hey, everyone,
let's get your boss laid" Saturday.

362
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,564
I have an announcement
to make.

363
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,860
I am moving to Costa Rica.

364
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:12,197
I've thought about it
for a long time, now,

365
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,032
and I'm finally gonna do it.

366
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,202
So...

367
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:20,539
I'm just gonna hop the
fence and jog home, then.

368
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,806
Those girls really
whaled on you bad.

369
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,516
Why wouldn't they
let me dance?

370
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,976
Okay, I gotta go.

371
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,061
Do not take him
to a hospital.

372
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,690
Pretty weird.

373
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,233
Do you have to go
with them?

374
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,609
I do, I have to go.

375
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,860
Stay. Just stay, please.

376
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,070
Okay, no. I have to go.

377
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:53,488
Good luck against
Conn College, all right?

378
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,698
Call me.

379
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,782
Uh-huh.

380
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:57,033
I'm not gonna call her.

381
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,118
I don't want to go back in.

382
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,327
I know. Here we go.

383
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,126
Cleaning people. Oscar?

384
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:11,256
Okay, so all you need to do is
explain to them what happened,

385
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,424
'cause I think they
can help us.

386
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:15,093
Why are you assuming
they only speak Spanish?

387
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,429
If they speak Spanish.

388
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,097
Good evening.

389
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,807
We locked ourselves in.

390
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,523
They happen to
speak Spanish.

391
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,941
Lucky us.

392
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,740
This is a one-time thing.
You know that, right?

393
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,491
Wow. All right!

394
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,993
This is it.

395
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,786
This is where
the magic happens.

396
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,663
Nice!
Very nice.

397
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,374
One of you can have the sofa,
and one of you can have the floor.

398
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,876
- I got the sofa.
- I got sofa.

399
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,085
Dwight, I got the sofa,
I'm the boss.

400
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,587
Come on. I got floor!

401
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,172
In case anybody needs
to go to the bathroom

402
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:54,424
in the middle of the night, I don't
want to get my head stepped on.

403
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,843
Do you want me to sing you a
song my mother used to sing me

404
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,428
when we were sick?
No.

405
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,349
Okay, Dwight. Dwight.

406
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,852
Leave him alone.
It's a lullaby.

407
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:09,189
Ryan? Ryan, we're
gonna take your clothes off.

408
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,357
No!

409
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,069
Guys...

410
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:18,323
I think my friend Troy
might have a drug problem.

411
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,367
What do I do?

412
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,912
I think his species might have
a higher tolerance than ours.

413
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:25,955
Just stop.

414
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,957
Here's what you do.

415
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:32,962
You tell him that you're his friend
and that you're going to help him,

416
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,131
and that everything's
gonna be all right.

417
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,344
And then you put
a wire on him,

418
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,263
and you find out
who's selling him drugs.

419
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,975
And then you get that
guy and you flip him.

420
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,770
You turn him into a snitch.
You follow that guy

421
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,940
to the people who're
really, really bad.

422
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:55,819
I've been watching The Wire
recently. I don't understand a word of it.

423
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,153
Guys, I'm going
to sleep.

424
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,323
You can leave the light on if you
want, but please stop talking, okay?

425
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:02,158
Okay. Good night, Ryan.

426
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,952
Good night, Ryan.

427
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:08,707
Best night ever.

428
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:10,542
Like I said,

429
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,753
it's not about the horniness.
It's about the loneliness.

430
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:16,381
And how can I be
lonely with my boys?

431
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,676
Like a famous
person once said,

432
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,678
Boys on the Side.

433
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,680
But I don't... I disagree.

434
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:27,392
I say, Let's Hear
It for the Boys.

435
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,451
Son of a bitch.
