1
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:06,839
Coat!

2
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,426
Michael just rented
The Devil Wears Prada.

3
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,554
He has his Netflix
sent here to the office,

4
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,932
and he watches them in
pieces when things are slow.

5
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:18,684
Steak!

6
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,687
Where's my steak?

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,356
He's a big
Meryl Streep fan,

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,818
so I shouldn't be surprised that
he's identified with her character.

9
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,445
Get me Armani.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,530
A suit?

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,031
On the phone.

12
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,156
Like the main
company number?

13
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,284
"Cause I'm gonna have to call
information. Where's Armani?

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,330
He's on the phone. Too
slow. You're not going to Paris.

15
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:40,914
I'm so much
better than you.

16
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,056
I owe you an apology.

17
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,306
You finished the movie.

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,851
Yeah. It was awesome.
Big surprise ending.

19
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:01,936
Won't ruin it for you.

20
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,854
No. Go ahead.

21
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,649
Meryl Streep is the bad guy.
Never see it coming.

22
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:11,232
Anyway, if I was mean in
any way to you, I am sorry.

23
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:15,073
I just want what's
best for you, minooshka.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,120
Minooshka.

25
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:24,082
Mo cuishle. He's watching
Million Dollar Baby.

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,588
He's gonna try to kill me.

27
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,207
So this one goes with my eyes,
and this one goes with your eyes.

28
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,167
People have said
I have very pretty eyes.

29
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,460
You do.

30
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:11,630
I haven't heard the same about
you. So let's just go with mine.

31
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,258
Well, they both go with
the carpet that I've ordered,

32
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,386
and if we go with the brown leather
on the sofas then they go with that, too.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,054
We already have
a sofa so why are...

34
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:20,681
A futon's not a sofa.

35
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,725
It folds up.
You've only seen it flat.

36
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,892
I know what
a futon is, Michael.

37
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:26,520
I... Okay. How much
is this gonna cost?

38
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,980
It costs what it costs.

39
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,565
No. That doesn't
even mean anything.

40
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,275
We have gone through this,
okay. We have gone through this.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,984
Yes. Money has been a little bit
tight lately, but at the end of my life,

42
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:41,451
when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna
be thinking about how much money I have?

43
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:46,035
No. I'm going to be thinking
about how many friends I have,

44
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:50,586
and my children
and my comedy albums.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,423
I mean, I have a yacht, so I
obviously did pretty well money-wise.

46
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,719
It's just, you know, you
say it's gonna cost what it...

47
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:01,889
Yeah? PAM: Michael,
it's Ryan for you.

48
00:03:01,972 --> 00:03:04,724
Conniving little runt.
Put him through.

49
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,436
Put him through.
Yes? Ryan, my man.

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,230
I sent you an e-mail about
the new PowerPoint.

51
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,772
Yes. And thank you
for sending that to me.

52
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,650
I had IT install the updated
PowerPoint on your computer

53
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,360
SO you can use it
for the presentation.

54
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,195
I really want people
there using PowerPoint.

55
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,531
Okay. Yeah.
No, I don't know.

56
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,575
I don't know. I think
those IT guys messed up.

57
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,951
Hold on.
I'll get them on the phone.

58
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,745
Wait. No. Here it is.
Here it is. Found it.

59
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,539
Sure.
I can hold.

60
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,376
Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight Schrute.

61
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,793
Please hold.

62
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,850
Schrute Farms, Guten Tag.
How can I help you?

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,897
Yes, we have availability on those
nights. How many in your party?

64
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,981
Oh, no. I'm sorry. No
king beds. No queen either.

65
00:03:57,486 --> 00:04:01,656
Well, we make our own mattresses that
don't conform to the traditional sizes.

66
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,659
Closest would be twin.

67
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,705
Thank you so much for calling.
Call back again. Auf Wiedersehen.

68
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,666
Hey, Dwight.

69
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,252
None of your
business, Jim.

70
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:14,336
You running
a bed and breakfast?

71
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,712
It is not a B&B.

72
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:18,799
Agrotourism is a lot more
than a bed and breakfast.

73
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:23,383
It consists of tourists coming
to a farm, showing them around,

74
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,182
giving them a bed,
giving them breakfast.

75
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,228
Does the Department
of Health know about this?

76
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,896
I am not telling you anything.

77
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,272
Permits are pending.

78
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,567
Dwight Schrute,
Dunder Mifflin.

79
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,651
Hello.
I'm looking for a room.

80
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,696
Okay. This is a misuse
of company phones.

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,199
It says here you
cater to the elderly.

82
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,283
Where did you read that?

83
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:45,992
Trip Advisor.

84
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:51,414
Trip Advisor is the lifeblood
of the agrotourism industry.

85
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,502
A couple of bad reviews there,
you may as well close up shop.

86
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,587
That's what took down
the Stalk Inn,

87
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,963
one of the cutest little
asparagus farms you'll ever see.

88
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,051
How many in your party?

89
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,136
Two.

90
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,306
We offer tours of the
fields and of the barn.

91
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,810
Perhaps you'd be interested in
Mose's table-making demonstration?

92
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,313
So, I forgot to tell you
that I need the car tonight.

93
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:17,857
Oh, actually
I need the car.

94
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,610
Why? For improv?

95
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,488
Why don't you just pretend
that you have a car?

96
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:28,577
Good practice in case you ever do a scene
where you need to pretend you have a car.

97
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,456
Used to have two cars, traded
them in. Now we're down to one.

98
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:37,498
Good economic sense, although
the new car's a Porsche, for her.

99
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,589
One cardigan.

100
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,051
One sleeping cardigan.

101
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,220
One sleep apnea mask.

102
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,476
What about my
cherub figurine?

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,727
You took that with you.

104
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,313
No. I left it
on my night...

105
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,399
Your night table,
by the lamp.

106
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:00,358
You are incorrect.

107
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:04,112
I was recently scrubbing my room
of memories, and I didn't see it there.

108
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,281
Fine.

109
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,617
My girlfriend
and I broke up recently,

110
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,412
and I must say
I am relieved.

111
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,914
It gives me a chance
to sow my wild oats.

112
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,290
In the Schrute family,

113
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,960
we have a tradition where when
the male has sex with another woman,

114
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:23,544
he is rewarded with a bag of wild
oats left on his doorstep by his parents.

115
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:27,135
You can use those oats to make
oatmeal, bread, whatever you want.

116
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,137
I don't care.
They're your oats.

117
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:34,392
The bar uses an applause
meter. That's why it is so important

118
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:38,976
that you all come and applaud
only for my band, Scrantonicity ll.

119
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,526
Not Scrantonicity, which
I am no longer a part of.

120
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,196
Michael, can I count on you?

121
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,906
You cannot.
I have a thing tonight.

122
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,283
Damn it.

123
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,202
Michael.

124
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,204
What?
That reminds me.

125
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,248
If the invitation
still stands,

126
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,126
Pam and I would love
to have dinner tonight.

127
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,920
Oh, no.
I have a thing tonight.

128
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,714
That stinks.
Darn it.

129
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:05,965
Shoot.

130
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,010
How about this weekend?
No. Can't.

131
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:12,514
We only had tonight free, and we
really wanted to spend it with you.

132
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,809
Damn it to hell.
Okay, all right.

133
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,770
What do you got
going on tonight?

134
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,814
You wouldn't understand.
It's a secret.

135
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,609
I wouldn't understand
or it's a secret?

136
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,569
You wouldn't understand, Jim.
It's a secret.

137
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,247
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien. I
didn't mean to interrupt your dinner.

138
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,082
I just have a very
exciting offer.

139
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:43,253
My records indicate that you have
expressed interest in losing some weight.

140
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,421
Well, what if I told you

141
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,841
that I have a pill that will make you
50 pounds lighter in five minutes?

142
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,217
How would that sound?

143
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,468
Amazing, right?

144
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,471
Well, it won't be
that fast, but it will...

145
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,266
It will be that easy.

146
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,688
I can't believe
this place is real.

147
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,441
I mean, I've heard about his beet
farm for years, but I never thought...

148
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,734
The Beets Motel.

149
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,736
The Beets Motel?

150
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,446
That is... Wow.

151
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,906
Thank you.

152
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,991
The Borscht Hotel.

153
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,911
The Embassy Beets.
Radish Inn.

154
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
How are you doing this?

155
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,538
I don't know.

156
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,799
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,473
I just love sales. I love it to
death. It's as simple as that.

158
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,982
And I don't get to do enough of it as
a manager, so I took this second job

159
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,443
kind of as a hobby.

160
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,155
Some people have
golf or relaxing...

161
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,157
What's going on here?

162
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:58,161
Hey. I just got off the phone,
and I was gonna make another call.

163
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,748
We're a legit operation with a
license from the city. I can show you.

164
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,834
We pay minimum wage
against commission.

165
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:08,417
Nope. They're with me, so... This
is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars.

166
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,884
We have three rooms,
each with a different theme.

167
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,427
What are the themes?

168
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:18,139
America, Irrigation
and Nighttime.

169
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,224
Irrigation.

170
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,350
Nice.

171
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,644
I'll put you down
for Irrigation.

172
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,897
Now then, do you have any
special needs or dietary restrictions?

173
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,817
Yes. We will be requiring
a bedtime story.

174
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,610
No.

175
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,946
Not even Harry Potter?
No, Jim, come on.

176
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,241
- But you promised...
- Mose, bags, now.

177
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,206
Here we are.
Irrigation room.

178
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,585
A very special room. So I'll come get
you before the table-making demonstration.

179
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:51,631
And as of this morning, we are
completely wireless here at Schrute Farms,

180
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,008
but as soon as I find out
where Mose hid all the wires,

181
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,886
we'll get that power back on.

182
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,345
All righty.

183
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,646
Everybody in the conference
room in five minutes.

184
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:11,109
These meetings are useless.

185
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,903
I just want to remind you
to stick to the script.

186
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,947
It's been proven
to work, so...

187
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,954
Got it?

188
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:23,580
Very inspirational.

189
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:30,128
We're offering a $50 bonus tonight
to the guy with the most sales, okay?

190
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,379
Or a woman.

191
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,131
Or a trained seal.

192
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,135
You can make jokes when you've
made a sale there, rookie. Okay?

193
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,436
I'd say one in six.

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,687
What?

195
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,399
I thought you asked me what our chances
were of being murdered here tonight.

196
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:55,983
You know, I just realized this is
Pam's and my first night away together.

197
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,366
I used to play it
over in my head,

198
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:02,034
and it was just
a little bit different.

199
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,619
Maybe a nice hotel or
a romantic dinner, wine,

200
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,295
but wine that wasn't
made out of beets.

201
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,672
Didn't think Dwight
would be involved at all.

202
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:17,717
And I always
imagine less manure.

203
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,054
I mean some manure,
just less.

204
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,347
This is beet food.

205
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,184
Mose, what are you doing?
No, Mose. Put the manure down.

206
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,020
Put it down! Do
not throw it! Do not...

207
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:31,147
Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?

208
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,232
Yeah. Who is this?

209
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,235
Well, I'm just calling because
you responded positively to...

210
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,570
Michael?

211
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,114
Stanley?

212
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,033
Why are you calling
me here at home?

213
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:44,744
Senor, are
you happy with your long-distance service?

214
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:48,164
Michael, I know that's you. Why
are you calling me here at home?

215
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,416
Have you...

216
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,418
Have you considered
satellite television?

217
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,670
Michael, I know that's you.
I know your voice.

218
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:55,756
All right.

219
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,966
Why are you calling
me here at home?

220
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,010
When
I'm at home, at night, in my own house,

221
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:04,555
in my sweats drinking some red
wine, watching my mystery stories,

222
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,850
the last thing in
the whole godforsaken world

223
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,686
I want to hear is the
voice of Michael Scott.

224
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,396
Well, your son sounds
like he's really motivated.

225
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,316
I think it's crazy that the
coach won't play him, frankly.

226
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:16,734
My office.

227
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:18,236
You bet.

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,614
Just dial the number on the
sheet and stick to the script.

229
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:23,866
Say those words
exactly, got it?

230
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,078
I don't know why we have to
keep having this conversation.

231
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:30,123
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale.
I just needed a few more minutes to...

232
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,375
A few more minutes
is a waste of our time.

233
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,210
It's not a waste of time.
This is a trading game.

234
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:35,795
No. Look.
You give a quick pitch,

235
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,298
you make the sale, you move
on. That's how Vikram does it.

236
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,175
Vikram doesn't have
my people skills.

237
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,761
Good for Vikram, because
he outsells you every night.

238
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,598
No. Well, I hope
this conversation has helped.

239
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:53,897
"And Harry saw the
white hand raise its wand

240
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,525
"and felt Voldermort's
surge of vicious anger.

241
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,694
"Saw the frail old man
on the floor writhe in agony.

242
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,281
"'Harry.' It was over
as quickly as it had come.

243
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,116
"Harry stood shaking
in the darkness,

244
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,286
"clutching the gate into
the garden, his heart racing."

245
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,624
What you got tonight?

246
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,336
It looks like mixed masala,
eggplant and rice.

247
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,088
Oh, that looks good.

248
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:20,965
And what about you?
Peanut butter flavor again?

249
00:13:21,883 --> 00:13:25,678
I am going with the
vanilla crisp this evening.

250
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:26,763
Enjoy.

251
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,265
Thank you.

252
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:32,852
I was a surgeon back home.

253
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,228
Really?
Yeah.

254
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,397
Wonder what I would
have been back home.

255
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,939
Well, this is your home.

256
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,486
I know, but it's so
competitive here.

257
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,030
What's $1 worth
in your land?

258
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,784
Medical school must have cost like
40 bucks or a donkey or something.

259
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,619
Uh, no.

260
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,290
I would have been
chief of surgery.

261
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:58,920
Or a cowboy.

262
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:05,802
Wait, you're
going out there?

263
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,929
Yeah. Coward.

264
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:28,116
Oh, my God.
What century is this?

265
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,203
You know what, here's
the thing about Die Hard 4.

266
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:36,787
Die Hard 1, the original, John McClane
is just this normal guy, you know?

267
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,170
He's just a normal
New York City cop

268
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:44,632
who gets his feet cut, and he gets
beat up, but he's an everyday guy.

269
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:49,258
In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a
motorcycle into a helicopter in the air.

270
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,389
Yeah.

271
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,724
You know? He's invincible.

272
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,019
It just sort of lost what Die
Hard was. It's not Terminator.

273
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,480
Dude, you should
review movies.

274
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:00,106
Oh, my God. Yes.

275
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
I'm telling you.
Yeah. You should.

276
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:03,985
I actually wrote a movie.
Really?

277
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,320
Well, I'm writing one, yeah.

278
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,822
What's it about?

279
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:08,406
Sort of a spy thriller.

280
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,450
Hey, what's so captivating?

281
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,162
I love captivating things,

282
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,041
and this must really be captivating
because it's keeping you off the phones.

283
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,670
I mean, time is your money. That's
how I know how captivating it is

284
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:24,255
because of how much time
you've spent talking.

285
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,637
Your turn.

286
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,824
Come in. Did
you have another nightmare?

287
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,412
Hey, Dwight.

288
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,624
Oh, Jim.

289
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,752
I thought you were Mose.

290
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,963
Does Mose have nightmares?

291
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,590
Oh, yes.
Ever since the storm.

292
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,139
Is everything satisfactory
with your stay?

293
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:17,183
Yeah. Yeah.

294
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,060
Great.

295
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:23,644
Just thought I heard crying or
moaning or something in here.

296
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,070
Oh, well, I'll look into
that in the morning.

297
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,368
Thank you for bringing that
to the attention of the staff.

298
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,496
Good night, Dwight.

299
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,350
Hey, so we're all gonna go out
for a beer. You want to come?

300
00:16:58,433 --> 00:16:59,600
We'd love for you
to come, Michael.

301
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,103
Thanks, no. I have to
work in the morning, so...

302
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,396
All right.
Next time, dude.

303
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,106
Okay. See you guys.

304
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,027
Hey, how you doing?

305
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,570
You drive.
I had too much wine.

306
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,781
Okay.

307
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,491
How was yoga?

308
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,535
I didn't go.
Why?

309
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,537
Why not?
I just didn't.

310
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,622
Okay.

311
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,206
How was improv?

312
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,127
Good night, Vikram.
Good night.

313
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,212
Hey, congrats
on the bonus.

314
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,296
Thank you, Michael.

315
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,672
I'm gonna nab it
one of these nights.

316
00:17:29,756 --> 00:17:33,426
Well, if you concentrate and
make your calls faster, yeah.

317
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,931
Good night.
Good night.

318
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:47,106
Michael.
Mmm.

319
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,860
Morning.
Hi.

320
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,162
Hey, Dwight.
How are you?

321
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,372
Pam.

322
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,833
You okay?

323
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,129
I am better than you have
ever been or ever will be.

324
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:17,512
Hey, guys. What's happening?
How's my favorite branch doing?

325
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:21,515
Okay, Michael, why
don't you start us off?

326
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,601
Um...

327
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,645
That wasn't much
of an introduction.

328
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:29,190
Ladies and gentlemen,
your boss, Michael Scott.

329
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,568
Oh, still lame. Okay.

330
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,945
All right.

331
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,158
Thank you, Ryan, for
that wonderful introduction.

332
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,747
Okay, today we're
going to be talking

333
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,585
about PowerPoint.

334
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,633
PowerPoint.
PowerPoint. PowerPoint.

335
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:59,216
Yes, I forgot about Ryan's presentation,
and yes, it would have been nice

336
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,473
to do well with the first
presentation that he had given me.

337
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,642
But you know what else
would have been nice?

338
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,936
Winning the lottery.

339
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,399
And the best way
to start is to hit "Start,"

340
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,695
and up comes the tool bar,
that's what she said.

341
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,279
What we have to do
here is go to "Run,"

342
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:25,284
and then you look
up to "PowerPoint."

343
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,667
And we are in.

344
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,379
We are going to register.
You hit "Register."

345
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,007
Updates are ready.
I should update.

346
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,219
"Estimated time 12 minutes."

347
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:42,596
So this should take
about five or 10 minutes.

348
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,724
Is this the first time
you've opened PowerPoint?

349
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,100
Why?

350
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,727
You didn't prepare a
presentation at all, did you?

351
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,397
No. I had a really rough night, and
my boss can back me up on that.

352
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,690
I'm your boss.

353
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,358
My other boss,
Mr. Figaro.

354
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,193
You have another job?

355
00:19:56,277 --> 00:20:00,777
What I do between 5:30 p.m. and
1:00 a.m. is nobody's business but mine

356
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,992
and my other business'.

357
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,119
Are you a cocktail waitress?

358
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:07,413
You cannot have
a second job

359
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,582
if it affects your
work here. It won't.

360
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,708
It did already.

361
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,835
Okay, honestly,

362
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,339
it is unlikely that I was
gonna figure this out anyway.

363
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:19,592
You're so funny.

364
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,677
Why is Darryl here?

365
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,761
He works
in the warehouse.

366
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,846
I invited him.

367
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,265
It's not a party. Darryl, back downstairs.
This isn't information you need.

368
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:29,810
This information here, yeah,
you're right, I don't need this.

369
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,938
Okay.

370
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,692
Hey, come on.

371
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,111
See you later tonight.

372
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,236
I got plans later.

373
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,946
Okay.
Bye, honey.

374
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:49,163
How long until you actually
get this presentation ready?

375
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:50,915
Why don't you do the
presentation? Honestly...

376
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,500
Because I don't want... I
mean, you know how to do it.

377
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,253
What I really want, honestly,
Michael, is for you to know it

378
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,087
so that you can communicate
it to the people here,

379
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,590
to your clients,
to whomever.

380
00:20:58,673 --> 00:20:59,715
Okay.

381
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,091
What?

382
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,552
It's whoever,
not whomever.

383
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:03,886
No, it's whomever.

384
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,554
No. Whomever is
never actually right.

385
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:06,722
Well, sometimes
it's right.

386
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:10,059
Michael is right. It's a made-up
word used to trick students.

387
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,938
No. Actually whomever is
the formal version of the word.

388
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,275
Obviously it's a real word, but I
don't know when to use it correctly.

389
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:19,360
Not a native speaker.
I know what's right,

390
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,737
but I'm not gonna say

391
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,739
because you're all jerks who
didn't come see my band last night.

392
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:24,824
Do you really know
which one is correct?

393
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,909
I don't know.

394
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:29,412
It's whom when it's the object of a
sentence and who when it's the subject.

395
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,539
That sounds right. Well,
it sounds right, but is it?

396
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,541
How did Ryan use it? As
an object? As an object.

397
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,168
Ryan used me
as an object.

398
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,418
Is he right about that?

399
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,545
How did he
use it again?

400
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:42,170
It was Ryan wanted Michael, the subject, to
explain the computer system, the object...

401
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,469
Thank you.
...to whomever, meaning us,

402
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:47,721
the indirect object, which is
the correct usage of the word.

403
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,976
No one asked you anything,
ever. So whomever's name is Toby,

404
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,395
why don't you take a letter
opener and stick it in your skull?

405
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,398
Hey, this doesn't matter,
and I don't even care.

406
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,318
Michael, you quit the
other job or you're fired here.

407
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:06,991
I've never done this before.

408
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,536
I have never quit
anything in my life.

409
00:22:11,704 --> 00:22:15,290
So you are filming history.

410
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:19,045
Nick, I had a dream last night
that I had two full-time jobs.

411
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,798
One here at the
lipaphadrazone diet pill company.

412
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:24,800
Lipophedrine.
And in the other,

413
00:22:24,884 --> 00:22:28,846
I was a regional manager of a small
paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.

414
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,931
Never heard of it.

415
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:31,056
In this dream,

416
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,640
I did both of these jobs beautifully
and I loved it and everybody loved me.

417
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:40,649
The truth is,
I can't do this.

418
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,359
Are you quitting?

419
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:44,945
I am.

420
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:48,741
Come back anytime. Don't
forget to disinfect your headset.

421
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,870
I was never in this
for the money.

422
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,960
But it turns out that the money
was an absolute necessity for me.

423
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:03,840
I tried to live the dream, I
tried to have a job, a girlfriend,

424
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:07,468
another job, and I failed.

425
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:13,678
But the good thing about the American
dream is that you can just go to sleep

426
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,563
and try it all again
the next night.

427
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,155
So...

428
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:30,950
What's up?

429
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,118
Me. All night.

430
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,661
Dreaming about Angela's
smoking hot body.

431
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,830
You're being gross.

432
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,874
Not from
a male perspective.

433
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:41,251
You need to set me up with her. I
know she told you that she's looking,

434
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,755
and she's totally not
responding to my moves.

435
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:44,839
What moves?

436
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,967
I have moonwalked past
accounting like 10 times.

437
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,302
I can't believe
that's not working.

438
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:50,386
Yeah.

439
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,471
Um...

440
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,891
I don't know if I really
see you two together.

441
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:59,474
Really? Well, maybe you should
look in the smart part of your brain.

442
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,938
She's very religious.

443
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:05,522
Okay, well, I come from a line of
WASPs so long it leads back to Moses.

444
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,947
Okay, well, she takes her convictions
pretty seriously. She can be kind of severe.

445
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,949
Yeah, and I punched
a hole in a wall.

446
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,993
That's right. You did. Yeah.

447
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,955
Now that I think about it, Angela and
Andy might actually make a good couple.

448
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,375
But I couldn't
do that to Dwight.

449
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,127
Or Angela.

450
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,504
Or Andy.

451
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,678
Hey, Kevin,
you're a gambler, right?

452
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,434
A rounder? You play
the ponies, small horses?

453
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:40,894
I do gamble, Michael.

454
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,440
Yeah. I was thinking about
doing some gambling myself.

455
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,192
You know, just a
little bit of money.

456
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,778
Maybe doubling it, then
doubling it several more times.

457
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:52,406
I don't know,
kind of just for fun.

458
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,990
I was thinking, do you have any
tips or ideas about sure things?

459
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:01,290
Like a boxer

460
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:05,669
who is gonna throw
the big fight?

461
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:09,507
You know, like he's tied
into some crooked dealings

462
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,594
and maybe his kid is sick or
something? Like, who do I call about that?

463
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,180
The mob.

464
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,850
Do you know
anybody in the mob?

465
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,813
Okay.

466
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,108
Oscar,

467
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,363
I'm gonna need to
take another advance on my salary.

468
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,406
What do you mean
you have plans tonight?

469
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,451
I have my daughter tonight.
We're renting Charlotte's Web.

470
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,036
Well, you have
to make a choice.

471
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,579
It's either your
daughter or me.

472
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:42,206
My daughter.

473
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,791
Okay.

474
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,585
That's how it is.

475
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,464
Oops!

476
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,219
That was cold.

477
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,686
He's always been
terrible with money.

478
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,564
I bet it's Jan spending him
straight to the poorhouse.

479
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:08,815
Yeah.
Women be shopping.

480
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,068
I can't believe he
has a second job.

481
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,486
He's not even good
at his first one.

482
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,779
Hey, guys.

483
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,864
Shh.

484
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,618
What you talking about?

485
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:24,373
Okay. I know what's going on.
You're talking about Jim and Pam,

486
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,624
if they're having sex,

487
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,209
what it looks like,
and I think... Michael.

488
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:28,794
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:33,090
Michael, are you
having money problems?

490
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,593
Monkey problems? No, I'm
not having monkey problems.

491
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,260
Why would I have
monkey problems?

492
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,512
I know you
heard me correctly.

493
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,097
Oh, I hate monkeys.

494
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,017
What's going on? Why
do you have a second job?

495
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,894
I don't have a second job.

496
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:49,272
Maybe I am having an affair
with Suzanne Somers.

497
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,608
Doesn't Jan have money?

498
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,234
I don't talk to my
girlfriend about money.

499
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,986
It is rude and unsexual.

500
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,112
True.

501
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,489
It's best to hide our money
problems from women.

502
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:01,952
I totally agree with you, but I
don't have money problems.

503
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:04,621
All right, you know what?
Watch this.

504
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,544
If I had money problems,
would I do this?

505
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,012
Well...

506
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,097
You just put
it back in your pocket.

507
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,264
Yeah.

508
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:25,476
Yeah, but I destroyed it.
It's not even useable anymore.

509
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:31,774
Hey, let's call
this what it is.

510
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,571
It's like she only wants to hook
up when Ryan comes around.

511
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,239
It's gotten to the point
where I get excited

512
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:42,576
every time I see that little
dude walk through the door.

513
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:46,288
Well, I just need to know
where this is going.

514
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,957
Hey, I like you.

515
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,294
All right?

516
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,379
What's not to like?

517
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:58,592
But you need to access
your un-crazy side.

518
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,720
Otherwise maybe this
thing has run its course.

519
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,225
Don't you dare walk away
from me, Darryl Philbin.

520
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,351
You are the most
selfish person

521
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,811
I have ever
met in my entire...

522
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,188
Slow down.
Think it over.

523
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:17,277
Darryl Philbin is the most
complicated man that I've ever met.

524
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:20,364
I mean, who says exactly
what they're thinking?

525
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,826
What kind of game is that?

526
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:30,290
Hey, cuz. Heard you're
having money problems.

527
00:28:30,374 --> 00:28:31,500
No, you didn't.

528
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,960
Listen,
I got the answer.

529
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,338
You declare bankruptcy,
all your problems go away.

530
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,173
Creed Bratton has never
declared bankruptcy.

531
00:28:38,257 --> 00:28:39,883
When Creed Bratton
gets in trouble,

532
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:44,012
he transfers his debt
to William Charles Schneider.

533
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,934
How would that help, Creed? In
Monopoly, you go bankrupt, you lose.

534
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,603
You don't go by Monopoly,
man. That game is nuts.

535
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,856
Nobody just picks up
Get Out of Jail Free cards.

536
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,859
Those things
cost thousands.

537
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,236
That is a good point.

538
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,197
Bankruptcy, Michael,
is nature's do-over.

539
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:04,700
It's a fresh start.
It's a clean slate.

540
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,619
Like the witness
protection program.

541
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:08,495
Exactly.
Not at all.

542
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:12,499
I've always wanted to be in
the witness protection program.

543
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,377
Fresh start.
No debts, no baggage.

544
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:19,798
I've already got my name
picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.

545
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:24,382
I'm a shipping merchant
who raises fancy dogs.

546
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,263
That's the life.

547
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:36,561
I declare bankruptcy!

548
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:49,494
Hey. I just wanted
you to know

549
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:53,039
that you can't just say the word
bankruptcy and expect anything to happen.

550
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,042
I didn't say it.
I declared it.

551
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,586
Still.
That's not anything.

552
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,756
This is a lot of
credit card debt.

553
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,424
Yeah. Tell me about it.

554
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:07,008
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and
she's using them as if I'm made of money.

555
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:10,307
She thinks I'm
a human ATM machine.

556
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,893
Okay, $125 at Amazon.

557
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,981
Oh, best of The Muppet
Show on DVD. Classic.

558
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,860
$1,200. What's a
Core Blaster Extreme?

559
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,947
That is by far the best
way to strengthen your core.

560
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:29,531
This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball,
you put your feet into the power stirrups,

561
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,746
you reach up and you
grab onto the super rod,

562
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,330
and you twist and you twist and you
twist. It strengthens your entire core,

563
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:42,919
your back core,
your arm core, your...

564
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,678
The Marine Corps actually uses
it. I think that's how they got corps.

565
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,727
I left a little
present for Angela.

566
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:57,938
I think she's
going to like it

567
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,275
'cause I found it outside
Vance Refrigeration all alone,

568
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,446
and I told her in the note
that the cat came to find her,

569
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:08,240
that they were
destined to be together.

570
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,036
I got game.

571
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:22,420
Okay, the green bar is what you
spend every month on stuff you need,

572
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,381
like a car and a house.

573
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,509
That's so cool how you
have my name at the top.

574
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,140
The red bar is what you
spend on non-essentials,

575
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,017
like magazines,
entertainment. Right.

576
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,519
Things like that.

577
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:41,144
This scary black bar is what you spend
on things that no one ever, ever needs,

578
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,487
like multiple magic sets,
professional bass fishing equipment.

579
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,739
How did you do this so fast?
Is this PowerPoint?

580
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,084
Oh, man.

581
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,170
Angela really had
a hold on him. Angela.

582
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:10,051
Michael, I'm gonna set you and
Jan up with a debt consolidator.

583
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,387
You meet with this guy...
No. No.

584
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,181
We are going to
leave Jan out of this.

585
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,474
She has to know.

586
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,059
We will find
another way.

587
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,145
We'll ask PowerPoint.

588
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,729
Michael, this is a
presentation tool.

589
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,149
You're a presentation tool if you
think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.

590
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,443
I'm done. No, you're
not... Okay. Just...

591
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,696
You're not a tool. Look,
we'll tell her that it's bad,

592
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,280
but it could have been a lot worse,
but due to some fancy financial footwork,

593
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,537
I was able to
cut it in half.

594
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,456
Jan is smart.

595
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,666
She poses.

596
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,422
Dwight, how's the
hotel business?

597
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:47,839
Stupid.

598
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,260
Have you checked
Trip Advisor recently?

599
00:32:51,343 --> 00:32:52,552
No.

600
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,764
Maybe you should.

601
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,017
Maybe you should...
Whatever.

602
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:05,774
We wrote a good review.
Under "Comments," we wrote,

603
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,610
"The natural aroma of the
beets drifts into the bedrooms

604
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,862
"and makes you dream
of simpler times."

605
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:14,574
"The dawn goose walk
will tug at your heart strings."

606
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,494
"Table-making
never seemed so possible.”

607
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,622
"You will never
want to leave your room."

608
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:24,376
"The architecture reminds one
of a quaint Tuscan beet farm.”

609
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,924
I'm glad you
enjoyed your stay.

610
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:33,135
We really did.
It was fun.

611
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:43,391
So due to Michael's
clever financial maneuvering,

612
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,107
he finds himself
tremendously in debt.

613
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,734
You're broke?

614
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,362
How did you get that
from what Oscar said?

615
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:55,115
How... I mean, Michael
how did this happen?

616
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,409
Where exactly did
your money go?

617
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:02,368
I don't... I don't get this.
I really don't. I don't...

618
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:07,165
I don't understand how you
could be So irresponsible.

619
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,463
I mean, it is
astounding to me, really.

620
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:15,844
I don't know what
more to say, it's just...

621
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,429
Jan?

622
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,556
Yeah? What?
Michael left.

623
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,767
Okay.
Where did he go?

624
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,435
I don't know.

625
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,564
Well, is he
coming right back?

626
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,358
I don't think so.

627
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:33,528
I'll be right there.

628
00:34:50,212 --> 00:34:54,341
What am I doing?
I am blowing Dodge.

629
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,386
I'm getting out of town.

630
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:01,014
Whatever you call it, I am running
away from my responsibilities.

631
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,934
It feels good.

632
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,566
You may ask me
out to dinner.

633
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:17,235
Nothing fancy or foreign. No bars, no
patios, no vegetables and no seafood.

634
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:26,998
Dwight?

635
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:53,233
Did I ever tell you why
I left Scranton?

636
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:58,405
Yeah, I didn't
think I had.

637
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,950
Well, it was all
about Pam.

638
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,541
Yeah. I mean,
she was with Roy,

639
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,919
and I just
couldn't take it.

640
00:36:14,546 --> 00:36:16,548
I mean,
I lost it, Dwight.

641
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:22,758
I couldn't sleep. I couldn't
concentrate on anything.

642
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:29,891
And weird stuff,
like food had no taste.

643
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,566
So my solution was
to move away.

644
00:36:36,735 --> 00:36:38,236
It was awful.

645
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,659
And it is something that I
wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

646
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,247
And that includes you.

647
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,160
Hey, I was thinking
about dinner, we...

648
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:36,252
Dinner. Let's see,
maybe we should try

649
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:38,463
the new Italian place where
the dry cleaner used to be.

650
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,589
Okay.
Yeah?

651
00:37:39,673 --> 00:37:41,549
Yeah.
Okay.

652
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:47,305
Jim's just really passionate
about Italian food.

653
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:53,102
Yeah. I'm very passionate
about Italian food.

654
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,234
In fact, I'm in love
with Italian food.

655
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:09,494
Jan, he went
running that way.

656
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,705
Okay, great. Thanks.

657
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,587
Runaway train,
never coming back

658
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,591
Run away
and I'm never coming back

659
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:23,925
Michael?

660
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,094
Hey, Jan.

661
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,056
What's going on?

662
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:34,019
Not much.
What's up with you?

663
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:35,478
Well, why are you
sitting on a train?

664
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:36,646
Where are you going?

665
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,523
I am out
of answers, Jan.

666
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,066
What does that mean?

667
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,360
I told you.
No more answers.

668
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,364
This is who I am now.

669
00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:49,492
A guy on a train
with no answers.

670
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,745
I hope that can be
enough for you.

671
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,206
Michael, come on.

672
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,499
Running away from your
problems won't solve anything.

673
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,167
You know that.
I don't know that.

674
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,504
Your creditors can follow
you anywhere with ease.

675
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:03,464
Your debt follows you
around the world, electronically.

676
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll stay off the grid.

677
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,885
Michael, come on.

678
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,222
Come on. You can deal
with this. It's not that bad.

679
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:12,724
Yeah, it is.

680
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,312
It is.
I really messed up.

681
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:20,523
Well...

682
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:23,401
When...

683
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:27,196
When my life fell apart and
they screwed me in New York

684
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:30,826
and I felt like my whole world was
collapsing around me, I didn't have anyone.

685
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:34,495
I mean, my whole family still won't
even talk to me on the advice of counsel,

686
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,250
and my friends were just
waiting for this to happen.

687
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,168
That's really
nice of you to say.

688
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:44,506
Michael, no. What I want to
say is you were there for me,

689
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,509
by my side,

690
00:39:48,635 --> 00:39:50,553
without even a thought.

691
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,765
That's just who you are.

692
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:02,395
I mean, no matter
how badly I treat you

693
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:08,363
or what I'm going through,
you just... You are there for me,

694
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,992
and that is a guy
worth staying beside.

695
00:40:14,536 --> 00:40:16,579
So where is this
train taking us?

696
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,210
I...

697
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,005
I think the engineer left.

698
00:40:57,412 --> 00:40:59,789
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute
calling from Dunder Mifflin,

699
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:04,168
and according to our records, you
appear to be low on office supplies.

700
00:41:04,252 --> 00:41:07,171
Okay. Sure. Yeah. I can
take care of that right now.

701
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,301
Don't sell your
implants, please.

702
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,720
I'm keeping them.
I know you like them.

703
00:41:17,265 --> 00:41:18,683
They're kind of
uncomfortable, though.

704
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,685
It's nice, though. Looks
cute. Kind of painful,

705
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,854
and my nipples aren't as
sensitive now. Looks cute, though.
