1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:03,669
And the same thing goes for
quarterly reports. They are unreadable.

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,171
They're just numbers
and boring and...

3
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:06,255
Blech!

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,425
So what I was thinking is that maybe
we should have some sort of graphic,

5
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,637
like if we have a bad
quarter, put in a storm cloud.

6
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,517
And when we have
a good quarter,

7
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,479
fireworks or a racecar.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,442
Doesn't have to be a racecar.
Use your imagination.

9
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,237
There's this cube on the screen,
and it bounces around all day,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,157
and sometimes it looks like it's heading
right into the corner of the screen,

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,327
and then at the last minute, it
hits a wall and bounces away.

12
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,788
We are all just dying to
see it go right into the corner.

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,794
Pam claims that she saw it one day
when she was alone in the conference room.

14
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,797
Okay. I believe she
thinks she saw it.

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,093
I saw it. I saw it,
and it was amazing.

16
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,344
Who said I didn't see it?
Did Jim say that I didn't see it?

17
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:55,470
I saw it.

18
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,473
We have a lot
of colored paper here.

19
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,977
Why, oh, why do we keep
printing this on white?

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,811
No! Come on!

21
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,188
Yeah! I know.

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,191
I know.
It's bland.

23
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,401
It's never going
to happen.

24
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:10,319
Dude, you gotta believe.

25
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:13,030
Maybe we could have
some sort of riddle?

26
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,115
Wait for it.

27
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:18,698
Like something that you have to
look for, sort of a Where's Waldo?

28
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,752
All right. All right.
Let's quit while we're ahead.

29
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,045
That was so awesome.

30
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,464
That was awesome.
Thank you.

31
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:36,053
Some days I am just on fire.
What can I say?

32
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,463
Hey. There he is.

33
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,215
Hey, Meredith.
How are you feeling?

34
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,050
I never thanked you
for coming to the hospital.

35
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,594
Oh, please. It was my
pleasure. Well, we all came, so...

36
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,888
Well, I really appreciate
you coming.

37
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:21,890
I'm singling you out.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,227
Anyway, I have
this Sharpie,

39
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,980
and I was wondering
if you could sign my cast.

40
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,523
Mmm-hmm.

41
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:35,862
Can you write
where I can read it?

42
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:37,322
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,414
I'll read this
when I get home.

44
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,832
All right.

45
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,421
Michael, this is the press
release I was telling you about.

46
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,215
Ryan wants you to
share it with everyone.

47
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:55,549
Does he?

48
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,925
He does.

49
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,887
Okay. Attention.

50
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,013
Earthlings,
I have some news.

51
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,184
Beep, beep, beep.

52
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,810
Beep, beep, beep. Okay.

53
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,772
Today is the big day that I'm
heading to New York to attend a party

54
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,899
with sushi and
important people.

55
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,986
On an unrelated note, if anybody
has an interesting anecdote

56
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,946
that is not boring
and easy to memorize,

57
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,907
please drop by my office
before I leave. Thank you.

58
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,910
Is that really what Ryan
wanted you to tell us?

59
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:28,494
And today, the Dunder Mifflin
Infinity website officially launches.

60
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,462
Well, the website is the
brainchild of my brainchild, Ryan.

61
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,589
It is my brain-grandchild.

62
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,883
And to celebrate its birth,

63
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,053
all of the different branches
are going to have satellite parties,

64
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:44,890
which will be connected,
via webcams and fibers,

65
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,685
to the real party, which is
going on in New York City

66
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:50,729
at a very
exclusive nightclub.

67
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,358
That is where
all of the VIPs,

68
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,942
including yours truly, will be
partying with New York City's finest.

69
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,907
And I do not
mean policemen.

70
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,451
The company is projecting
record high sales,

71
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,580
and that by 6:00, the website will be
the new best salesman in the company.

72
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:09,915
Wow. Watch out, Dwight.

73
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,710
That's ridiculous. I'm not
gonna be beaten by a website.

74
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:13,960
Actually it sounds
like you are.

75
00:04:14,044 --> 00:04:15,920
Really?
"Cause Ryan says so?

76
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,590
That's from Ryan? Does it
mention if he's seeing anybody?

77
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,133
No, it doesn't.
I'll find out tonight.

78
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,718
Yes, please let us know.

79
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,887
I can make more
sales than a computer.

80
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,349
In fact, I challenge that website
to make more sales than me today.

81
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,851
Waste of time.

82
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,226
What's that, pipsqueak?

83
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,022
Waste of time. The
website's going to win.

84
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:34,731
You believe a computer
can beat me?

85
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:35,982
I don't care,
but yes.

86
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,400
Well, I will
prove you wrong.

87
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,320
I don't care, and
you won't. You'll see.

88
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,196
I won't be watching,
and I won't.

89
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,492
Dwight mercy-killed
Angela's cat.

90
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,494
It's very complicated.

91
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:52,123
It's caused a lot of unpleasantness
between Dwight and Angela,

92
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,335
who were both already
prone to unpleasantness.

93
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,552
Stanley,
you're dancing.

94
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,095
No, I'm not.

95
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,891
Yeah, I created a website.

96
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:13,979
Look, at the end of the day,
Apple's apple is flying at 30,000 feet.

97
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,064
This is a paper company,

98
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,151
and I don't want us to get lost in
the weeds or into a beauty contest.

99
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,570
I told you I don't want
you doing these things in here.

100
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,989
You can use your own office
or do it in the hall.

101
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,243
Convergence, viral
marketing, we're going guerilla,

102
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,327
we're taking it
the streets,

103
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,412
while keeping an eye
on the street, Wall Street.

104
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,788
I don't want to reinvent
the wheel here.

105
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:34,499
In other words,
it is what it is.

106
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,168
Buying paper
just became fun.

107
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:42,757
And this is where
I will record your sales.

108
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:44,884
Very nice, very nice.

109
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,847
And then I will say something
positive like, "Kudos,"

110
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,599
or, "Job well done."

111
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,768
Or, "Zip-a-dee-doo-dah!"

112
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,730
I can't tell
if he's mocking me.

113
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,482
Just ignore him.

114
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:02,235
I can't do that. It's really
hard for me to let things go.

115
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,487
I was mocking.

116
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,031
Thank you.

117
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,494
I just feel like we need something
more to acknowledge when I make a sale.

118
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,621
Yes! Like a chime
or a bell.

119
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,123
Or a gong.

120
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,879
Go to my car, open the trunk,
inside you will see many pelts.

121
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:29,926
Under the smallest one is a case.
Inside that case is a bear horn.

122
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,264
Bring it to me.

123
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:32,515
Yes!

124
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,859
Isn't 7:00 p.m. a little
late for a lunch party?

125
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:46,404
Lunch party? It's supposed
to say "Launch Party."

126
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:48,657
What is wrong with you?

127
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,203
Angela is worse than usual
lately, and we have a party to throw,

128
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,332
so I googled, "How to
deal with difficult people.”

129
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,585
And I got all of this.

130
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,422
So we're gonna
try out some new things today.

131
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,967
So, how do you feel about the
fact that the banner says "Lunch"?

132
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,759
I feel angry. Angry at you. Angry
at you for doing something stupid.

133
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,809
Angry at me for believing you
could do something not stupid.

134
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,979
I'm so sorry to hear that.
That must be awful.

135
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,858
It is awful. You've
made this day awful.

136
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,361
Maybe you could just
change the U into an A.

137
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,114
Then it would say
"Lanch Party," Kevin.

138
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,158
Would it really be better
if it said "Lanch Party"?

139
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,283
Lunch party.

140
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,869
It's supposed
to say "Launch."

141
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,579
Okay, wow, easy,
booster seat.

142
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,706
Nobody cares about
this party anyway.

143
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,791
I care.

144
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:41,459
"Plan a party, Angela. Oh,
and the entire world will see it.

145
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:43,670
"Oh, and here's $65
for your budget.

146
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,506
"Oh, and here are four idiots who
will do nothing but weigh you down.

147
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,091
"Oh, and your
cat's still dead."

148
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,968
Twenty seconds
to go-time.

149
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,678
Got it. Carb up.

150
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,640
Really? Power Gel?

151
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:57,976
Hey, if you want to win,
you got to fuel like a winner.

152
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,063
Okay, we start.

153
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:04,233
As soon as
I make this shot.

154
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,525
Hey! Go!

155
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:06,651
Yeah!

156
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,489
Hello, Susan.
Dwight Schrute.

157
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:13,700
What would you say if I told you
we could pull a prank on Dwight,

158
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,994
at the same time,
not be working?

159
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,498
What? He's going
through a breakup.

160
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,875
Yeah. I'm aware of that, but
he's also being super-annoying,

161
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,003
and I'm not
a perfect person.

162
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,504
Yeah! Yeah!

163
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:27,714
Got one!

164
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,009
Three reams! In
your face, machines!

165
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,763
What kind of prank
are you thinking?

166
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:38,475
What if I told you
I could offer free shipping?

167
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,935
Sure, I'll hold.

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,206
Not sure.
Just became self-aware.

169
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,792
So much to figure out.

170
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,920
I think I am programmed
to be your enemy.

171
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,879
I think it is my job to destroy you
when it comes to selling paper.

172
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,075
It appears that
the website has become alive.

173
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,744
This happens to computers
and robots sometimes.

174
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,329
Am I scared of a
stupid computer?

175
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,249
Please, that computer
should be scared of me.

176
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,378
I have been salesman of the
month for 13 out of the last 12 months.

177
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,506
You heard me right.
I did so well last February,

178
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:54,509
that corporate gave me two
plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

179
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,476
Okay.

180
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:04,727
Yes, it's too tight.

181
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,813
Way too tight.

182
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,897
Really?

183
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,231
This is why
I'm here?

184
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,899
Why is it so tight?

185
00:10:09,983 --> 00:10:11,359
It's a European cut.

186
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,153
It just looks bad.

187
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,029
Um...

188
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,575
Hey, what's hanging?

189
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,410
Setting up the webcam
for the party.

190
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,120
Good, okay, cool.

191
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,418
How many pounds do you
think I can lose by 7:007?

192
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,545
Depends. How much have
you eaten already today?

193
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,381
I had one of those big...

194
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,592
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

195
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,554
Just one second. We're in a
meeting. I'll see if he's available.

196
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:40,972
It's Jan.

197
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:44,893
Why don't you want
to go tonight? What...

198
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,812
All your friends are going
to be there... My friends?

199
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,271
It'll be fun. Michael,
I was terminated.

200
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:49,648
Just...

201
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,940
Is it really that
important to you?

202
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,066
Yeah.

203
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,527
All right.
Thank you.

204
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,111
Go by yourself.

205
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,529
No. No.

206
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,325
No. If I go by myself, everybody
will think I'm a big loser.

207
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,870
Well... Do I have your
permission to invite Carole?

208
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,038
What? Jeez, Michael!

209
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,289
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:10,126
I'm sorry. It's just the first
girl that popped into my head.

211
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,669
I'll find somebody
that I haven't slept with.

212
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:14,380
Nice.

213
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:16,340
Website check, please.

214
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,135
305.

215
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:22,305
305. You, my friend,
are winning handsomely.

216
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,142
It just made
another sale. 380.

217
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:29,725
You, my friend, are
in a very close second.

218
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,855
402.

219
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:32,732
Okay, why don't you
just lay off, lady?

220
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,026
What do you want me to do?
Not announce it? 412.

221
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,117
So, this is the dealio.

222
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,494
God has smiled upon me

223
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,081
and given me two tickets to
the big party in New York, tonight.

224
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,417
What are you doing
this evening?

225
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:55,880
Look at that.

226
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:58,591
They have their own little
language now, like twins.

227
00:11:58,675 --> 00:11:59,717
Sure, we'll go.

228
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,636
All right. Well, fight it
out amongst yourselves.

229
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,388
I was thinking Pammy,

230
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,265
but boys' night out
is also good.

231
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,808
I'm sorry. What?

232
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,477
One of the tickets
is for him.

233
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:11,854
Just let me know
who the winner is.

234
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,275
Not it.
Not it. No!

235
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,401
I won.

236
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,445
Definitely not.
If anything it was a tie.

237
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,321
Tie goes
to the girlfriend.

238
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:25,452
No, I realize you normally reorder in
November, but what I'm suggesting...

239
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,537
You did what?

240
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,165
No. That's exactly what you're
not supposed to do, damn it!

241
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,751
Why would you reorder
from a computer

242
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,628
when you could have the
personal touch of a salesman?

243
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:38,840
How's it going?
Fine. Good.

244
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,300
Yeah?
Yeah.

245
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:41,759
You look
a little worried.

246
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,761
I do not look worried.

247
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,402
"Here's a suggestion,
computer.

248
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:02,822
"I assume you read binary, so
why don't you zero, one, one,

249
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:05,950
"one, one, one, Zero,
one, one, zero, one, one?"

250
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,577
Okay.

251
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,873
While you were typing that, I
searched every database in existence

252
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:16,169
and learned every fact about
everything and mastered the violin.

253
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,299
And sold more paper.

254
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:34,770
I asked for assorted cutlery,
and I got back spoons.

255
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,439
These are worthless.

256
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,316
I want to understand
what you're saying,

257
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,319
but it's difficult for me
when you use that tone.

258
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,701
Phyllis, these are spoons.

259
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:52,284
Spoons have rounded tops
and are used to scoop things.

260
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,041
What we need are forks,

261
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,920
which have prongs
or tiny spears on top.

262
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,799
And we need knives,
which have blades.

263
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,468
Do you understand me now?

264
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,554
Yes.

265
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:08,888
Goodie.

266
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,727
Hey, man.
What's up, man?

267
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,646
What's going on?
Paper delivery.

268
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,398
Oh, yeah?
Kelly ordered this online.

269
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,286
What are you doing?

270
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,163
I am in the fight of my
life against this computer,

271
00:14:33,246 --> 00:14:34,497
and every sale counts.

272
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,208
But you get to put the paper in this
little shopping cart and then it says,

273
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,752
"Thanks for shopping
with Dunder Mifflin."

274
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,673
Damn it, Kelly! It knows!
It knows what you did!

275
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,758
Who knows?

276
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:45,883
Return it!
Return it now!

277
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:47,176
Hey.

278
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,347
How about instead of yelling
at our sweet little Miss Kapour

279
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,057
over 500 sheets of paper,
you get back to your desk

280
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:55,726
and start selling
multiple reams like a man.

281
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,063
You don't understand.

282
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,773
Okay, if this makes
the difference,

283
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:03,985
I'm going to tell it
that you were responsible.

284
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,779
Who's "it"?

285
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,202
There you go.

286
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:13,577
Thanks.

287
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,497
So, you still
missing Ryan?

288
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,624
Not so much anymore.

289
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,339
I am not a bad person.

290
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,883
When I left Staples, I took
some of their leads with me,

291
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,052
but I never intended
to use them.

292
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,887
What did I intend
to do with them?

293
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,557
Who knows? Maybe
keep them as a souvenir,

294
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,808
maybe use them.

295
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,729
Yes, Mr. Galioto, how would
you like to pay 10% less for paper

296
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,689
than you're
paying right now?

297
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,442
It's not important how
I got your information.

298
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,571
What is important
is that you say yes. Good.

299
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:51,157
All right, I'm ready to go,
and I'm calling shotgun.

300
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,242
I'm driving?

301
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:53,743
Yes.
Thank you.

302
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,411
All right. Let me just
say goodbye to Pam.

303
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:59,373
Oh, yeah. You better say goodbye
to Pam. Say goodbye to Pam.

304
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,586
Bye.
I love you.

305
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,466
I love you. Okay.

306
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,386
I'm leaving
inside Jim's car

307
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,722
I don't know
when I'll be back again

308
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:18,305
Yes, I do,
tomorrow I'll be back

309
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,270
I'll be back tomorrow.

310
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,482
Yeah, so you know what? Why don't you
guys take off a little bit early tonight?

311
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,150
Because there's a party.

312
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:29,570
A party for the website I've
been planning for two weeks.

313
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:33,908
If you are not this tall, you
may not ride the rollercoaster.

314
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,034
See you guys tomorrow.

315
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:38,204
Perfect. So let me just get
some basic information from you.

316
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,883
Sorry. I'm so sorry. Yes.
Could you repeat that?

317
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,057
Yes! Ten reams for the
U.S. District Court!

318
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:01,310
Did I happen to mention the 40 reams
for the Battered Women's Shelter?

319
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:02,645
No!

320
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,861
Stop it. Give me that. Give it.

321
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:11,654
Did you see the board?

322
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,656
There's still an hour.

323
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,577
You ever read this?

324
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,705
Yeah. A long time
ago, but I liked it.

325
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,165
I got it for Ryan.

326
00:17:22,582 --> 00:17:24,417
I wanted to get him
Oh, the Places You'll Go!

327
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,543
But they were sold out.

328
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,504
I figured it's the same
sort of stuff in here.

329
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,132
It's not. It's different.
It's a good book.

330
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:34,468
What was that?

331
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,221
Leaving Pennsylvania.

332
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:39,307
Two kisses.

333
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
One for me.
One for Jan.

334
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:41,726
Gotcha.

335
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,311
You guys should come
over for dinner, you and Pam.

336
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,896
That would be fun.
Friday? That would be fun.

337
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,856
Want to come over Friday? Can't.

338
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,483
After work, you...

339
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,193
Oh, no, 'cause...

340
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,656
You're gonna let me know
when we're close, right?

341
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:56,657
Yes. Actually, I will
tell you right now.

342
00:17:56,741 --> 00:18:01,241
It's a club called Chat Room,
and there's a password to get in,

343
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,623
which is actually
"Password," so...

344
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,791
Okay.

345
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,709
What are you doing?

346
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,920
That is an invitation
to an online party.

347
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,214
No. No.
I'm sure that's not.

348
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,718
Are there three "W's" at
the beginning of the address?

349
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,514
Yes.
Yeah.

350
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,849
Well, the invitation says VIPs only.
Is this how you treat your VIPs, Ryan?

351
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,149
We're already
in the city.

352
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,653
The main part, with the buildings.
What am I supposed to do?

353
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,863
What do you want me
to do tonight?

354
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,155
And if you tell me

355
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:39,242
that I have to drive back to
Scranton to the satellite party,

356
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,036
I am going to throw up.

357
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,038
Okay, I am going
to throw up.

358
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,582
I'm throwing up. You're
making me throw up, Ryan.

359
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,834
You know what this is like?
I'll tell you what this is like.

360
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,086
This is like when the
freshmen would throw a party

361
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,548
and wouldn't let
any of the seniors go.

362
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:59,554
Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that
little twerp got the promotion over us?

363
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,973
Actually, I withdrew
from consideration.

364
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,892
Yeah. I withdrew too.

365
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:16,779
Four, three, two, one!

366
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,155
Yes!

367
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,702
After numerous projections
that the computer

368
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,996
would crush all
salesmen in its path,

369
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,580
I am very happy to report that
our very own Dwight Schrute

370
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,838
has crushed his electronic
nemesis, if you will,

371
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,299
by a whopping 52 reams.

372
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,592
Reams.

373
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,385
Wait, say it
again. Announce it again.

374
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,470
Fifty-two reams!

375
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,595
No, no.
No, the first part.

376
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,349
Dwight has
defeated the computer.

377
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,437
Hey, so,
what do you think?

378
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:52,231
I did it for you.

379
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,150
I didn't ask you
to do it for me.

380
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,068
You didn't have to.

381
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,405
How do you tell
someone it's over?

382
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,989
You send them a notarized letter, right?
Well, what if the recipient is your notary?

383
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,665
Hello, Pam.

384
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:10,499
Hello.
Hey,

385
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,918
do you have any men
that you can fix me up with?

386
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:15,671
I would like to have
a relationship with a man.

387
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,008
I'll get back to you.

388
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,551
Let me know.

389
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,985
All right,
who wants to party?

390
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,111
Why aren't you
in New York?

391
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,738
What?

392
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,782
I think I faked
Oscar out.

393
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,118
You said you weren't coming
back and we could leave early.

394
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:46,952
I think I faked
Stanley out, too.

395
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,955
Who else thought that I was leaving
and that you could all go home early?

396
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,666
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

397
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,836
Well, who needs New York?

398
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,463
Right? We can have a killer
party right here in Scranton.

399
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,631
Thank you.

400
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,801
No, no, no. This is going to be nothing
like the party you've been planning.

401
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,471
This is going to be good,
and everybody's gonna come.

402
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,308
What's wrong with Dwight?

403
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,433
He beat the computer.

404
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:13,354
Hey, good for you. Good
for you! Scranton power.

405
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,732
All right, you know what?

406
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,900
Angela, I'd like you to come
into my office in 10 minutes.

407
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,361
Bring something to write
with and something to write on.

408
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,529
Good!

409
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,285
It was a pretty
disappointing day.

410
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:31,705
It was kind of a slap
in the face to realize that

411
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,209
I wasn't as important
as I thought I was

412
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:38,379
to a certain young executive
who I'd cared about.

413
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:41,966
But, you know,
I'm not gonna cry over it.

414
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,426
I did that in the car
on the way home.

415
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,803
How are we
doing on time?

416
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,138
The party starts
in an hour.

417
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,558
Good. These are some things
that I would like to have happen.

418
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,771
"Beer, light beer,
streamers, orchids,

419
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:56,647
"better lighting,
something made of ice"?

420
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,441
Those are just things.
This is how I want it to feel.

421
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,986
"Pizza, pizza with mushrooms, pizza
without mushrooms, white pizza, steak"?

422
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,406
I would like this
party to be sexier,

423
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,158
cooler, more important...

424
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,993
"Chocolates,
someone famous"?

425
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,161
Yes.
"Cool music,

426
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,121
"confetti,
go-go dancers"?

427
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,999
I want it to embarrass
all other parties.

428
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,336
I want it to be a party
that the guys in New York

429
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,919
watch on the webcam and say, "Wow,
how did they get Al Roker to come?"

430
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,926
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

431
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,010
I can't do it.

432
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,804
Yes, you can.
I know you can.

433
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:30,306
I wouldn't say that if
I didn't 100% believe it.

434
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,058
Who else could do this?

435
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,351
Okay. Okay.

436
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,395
No, seriously, is there anyone
else who could do it better?

437
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,689
Because we don't
have a lot of time.

438
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,109
I'll get the pizza!

439
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,161
What do you
think of Angela?

440
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,498
I think she's efficient.

441
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,084
No, not like that.
As a woman.

442
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,754
W-O-M-A-N.

443
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,756
I hadn't noticed.

444
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,925
You hadn't noticed
she's a woman?

445
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,179
I hear she's single
and ready to mingle.

446
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,890
I'm thinking about
making a play for her.

447
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,059
What do you think?
Crazy, right?

448
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,729
I think it's inappropriate to
date someone you work with.

449
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,189
Isn't that
part of the fun?

450
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,525
No. I think you
should date Kelly.

451
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,237
She works here, too.
How is that any different?

452
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,489
She works in the annex.

453
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,576
You're also welcome
to date Toby.

454
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:34,912
Okay.

455
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,916
Good news!
We get to go home?

456
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:42,461
Guess who just ordered from
your favorite pizza place, Alfredo.

457
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,130
Wait.

458
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,759
Alfredo's Pizza Cafe?
Or Pizza By Alfredo?

459
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,344
Same thing.

460
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,720
No. No, it's not.

461
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:53,138
All right. You know
what? I don't understand

462
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:54,431
when you all talk
at the same time.

463
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,850
Oscar, talk to him.

464
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,854
Michael, there's a very big difference
between these two pizza places,

465
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:04,233
both in quality of ingredients
and in overall taste.

466
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,235
Which one did you
order from?

467
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,655
Pizza By Alfredo.

468
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,491
All right, you know what?
Okay, okay, what is better?

469
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:17,075
A medium amount of good pizza or
all you can eat of pretty good pizza?

470
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,166
Medium amount of good pizza.
Medium amount of good pizza.

471
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:26,126
Oh, no, it's bad.
It's real bad.

472
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,884
It's like eating
a hot circle of garbage.

473
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,598
You can pick
one of these things.

474
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,726
It's unreasonable for you
to ask me to do all of this.

475
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:43,147
It should take you no time at all if you
put the care into it that you normally do.

476
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:47,943
Ow!

477
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:49,737
That seemed
to shut her up.

478
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,242
You looking for
dinner and a movie?

479
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:57,077
"Cause you're not gonna
find it in that box.

480
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,708
It just so happens, I know
where you can find it, but again,

481
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,379
not in the box.

482
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,967
Angela, are you hearing
words that I'm saying?

483
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,177
What?

484
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,470
Hello.

485
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:16,972
I have been working
on a party for three weeks

486
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,474
that just got thrown
out the window,

487
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,726
so now I have to pull
together a whole new party,

488
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,561
and my useless
number two quit.

489
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,271
So now there's no one
in charge of orchids,

490
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:26,315
chocolates or the thing
that's made of ice.

491
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,192
And my upper back itches,
and it's itched all day,

492
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:31,737
and I can't reach it. And Kevin
had Greek food for lunch again!

493
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,536
They say you should never mix
business with pleasure.

494
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,661
Really?

495
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,541
Well, then explain to me how a
putt-putt golf company operates.

496
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,630
Yeah?

497
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,340
The Pizza By Alfredo
guy is here.

498
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,633
You don't have
to say it like that.

499
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,968
I said it normal.

500
00:25:58,514 --> 00:25:59,890
Hey.

501
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:02,476
$63.50, and that's
not including tip.

502
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,019
Right.
I have a coupon,

503
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:07,815
so half of $63.50 and
half the tip on $63.50...

504
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,818
Half-off coupons only
apply to orders of two pizzas.

505
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,613
Yeah, no, I told them on the
phone I was ordering eight pizzas.

506
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:15,114
I don't care what you
told them on the phone.

507
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,908
That's our policy.

508
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:19,827
You didn't actually think that I was
going to spend 60 bucks on pizza?

509
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,162
It's not pizza.
Okay.

510
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:25,624
It doesn't say it anywhere on
the coupon, and if it's your policy,

511
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:27,710
it should say it
on the coupon.

512
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,754
What do you mean?

513
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:30,838
Not my problem.

514
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,381
It is your problem.

515
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:37,716
That's no way to do
business, okay? I ordered

516
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,472
eight pizzas with
a half-off coupon,

517
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:42,891
so I would like eight pizzas
for half-off. End of story.

518
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:46,687
It's a great story. It's $63.50,
and that's not including tip.

519
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,272
I'm not giving that to you.

520
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,358
Well, then you're not
getting your pizzas.

521
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,401
No. No!
You're not... No!

522
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:56,030
You are not going anywhere!
You're going to stay here

523
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,366
until we figure this out! What?

524
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:02,949
You know what? This young man needs to
learn that that's not how you treat people!

525
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,998
I don't care if it's pizza!

526
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:10,461
Good business is about respect
and accountability and follow-through.

527
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,296
You don't just
make promises

528
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,299
and pull the rug out from
under somebody, do you?

529
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,219
Dwight, please escort this young
man into the conference room.

530
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:19,469
Right now. Get into
the conference room.

531
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,138
I'm not going in there.
Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are.

532
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,974
And you will come out when you
decide to give me a discount on the pizza.

533
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:25,476
Please. Thank you.

534
00:27:26,185 --> 00:27:27,186
This is stupid.

535
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,022
No, you don't even
know what stupid is.

536
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:33,942
It's about to get
all stupid up in here!

537
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,208
You find anything?

538
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,794
We think it's a
straightforward kidnapping.

539
00:27:52,378 --> 00:27:54,129
Stanley, could you
look up accomplices?

540
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,589
Why can't you guys do it?

541
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,841
Because we're
looking up jail time.

542
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,719
Fine.

543
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:00,928
I've seen this kid before.

544
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,389
He's one of the kids that sneaks
onto my farm and steals my hemp.

545
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,268
Yeah, I know that guy. He's that
farmer that grows really crappy weed.

546
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,153
You ready to give me
my discount now?

547
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:18,362
No.

548
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,781
Okay, what have you been
doing in here this whole time?

549
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,116
What kind of
business is this?

550
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,326
We're a paper company.

551
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,077
The best paper company
in the whole wide world, okay?

552
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,204
All right, Dwight,
knock it off.

553
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,416
You'd better think about what
you are doing, young man.

554
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,000
You better think about
what you're doing.

555
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:36,584
No! I'm an adult. I don't
have to think or do anything.

556
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:40,008
You're a kid. You're a
little, snot-nosed punk kid

557
00:28:40,092 --> 00:28:42,260
who thinks he's better
than everybody else,

558
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,763
because he's some hotshot.

559
00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:46,223
And you don't know
anything about sales!

560
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,309
So stop being a
disrespectful little jerk, okay?

561
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,476
Sales?

562
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,062
Yes, sales. You sell pizza. Last
time I checked, that's called sales.

563
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:53,147
You're such a loser.

564
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,232
What did you
just call him?

565
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,983
A loser.
What did you say?

566
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,234
A loser.
What?

567
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,610
A loser.
What was that word?

568
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:00,570
Stop getting him
to say it!

569
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,906
You just made this worse,
a whole lot worse.

570
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,241
I can make
him talk, Michael.

571
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,326
- Michael!
- Michael!

572
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:06,868
We are accomplices.
I'm not going to jail for this.

573
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,537
Stop talking all at once!

574
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,747
You need to let him go.

575
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,166
Let go of little jerk-boy before
he has learned his lesson?

576
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,835
Yes.
You know what, Jim?

577
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,797
The world would be a better place if people
were held accountable for their actions.

578
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,632
Yes, but not by
kidnapping them.

579
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,092
I'm not kidnapping him.

580
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:24,469
I'm keeping him
until I get what I want.

581
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,637
As a hostage.

582
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:26,722
I think you're
over-thinking it.

583
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,807
I think you're
under-thinking it.

584
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,558
Yes.
Is Alfredo there?

585
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,936
May I speak to
a manager, then?

586
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:37,733
Okay, could you tell the manager
that I am keeping his delivery kid

587
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,569
until I get my discount on
the eight pizzas I ordered?

588
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,447
Yes, I know it is
not on the coupon.

589
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:48,907
Also, I would like him to
throw in two, three pizzas,

590
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,831
just for our...
Ransom.

591
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:53,999
...trouble.

592
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,669
Okay. All right.

593
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,463
What did he say?

594
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,590
He said no.

595
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,841
So we should let him go.

596
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:04,259
No. No.

597
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,469
Okay.

598
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,888
Listen up, kid,

599
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:09,931
I don't like you,

600
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:14,145
but because some town in
Switzerland says so, you have rights.

601
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,776
I have to hang these.

602
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,411
Why are you looking
at her like that?

603
00:30:30,494 --> 00:30:31,703
Hey!

604
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:43,882
What's going on?

605
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:46,009
Michael just called the pizza
place with a list of demands.

606
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:47,719
Mr. Overdramatic.
What's up, Kevin?

607
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:49,805
We're getting hungry
out there.

608
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,390
We're all accomplices now anyway,
so we figured we might as well eat.

609
00:30:55,811 --> 00:31:00,311
We would like to order some
good pizza from Alfredo's Pizza Cafe

610
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:05,404
while we wait for the hostage
situation with the bad pizza to end.

611
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,994
I needed another hour. It could
have been done in another hour.

612
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,788
I think it looks good.

613
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,831
That's why you're not
in charge, Meredith.

614
00:31:20,961 --> 00:31:24,047
Here you are, my dear.
One thing made of ice.

615
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:28,302
How did you...

616
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,013
Where'd you...

617
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,849
It's just ice. It'll melt
all over the floor.

618
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,184
Will you help me
put it over there?

619
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:36,810
Yes, I will.
Okay.

620
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:38,061
Excuse me.

621
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,314
I stole it.

622
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,986
Thank God.

623
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,990
Michael? Ryan wants to introduce
the branch managers in a few minutes.

624
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,117
You just have to wave
and introduce yourself.

625
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,494
I'll just wave and
introduce myself.

626
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:55,912
Hey, quick question.

627
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:56,997
Yeah?

628
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,999
If I take a pizza,

629
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,836
do you think you could take some
sodas and some napkins up to the roof?

630
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,838
I'm all over it.
Good.

631
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,465
What do we got here?

632
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,134
Good pizza.
Yeah?

633
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:11,220
Cheese? Or do we
have other flavors?

634
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:12,387
Different stuff.

635
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,264
Which one is this?
Perfect.

636
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,769
Do you remember what you
said to me on my first day at work,

637
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,355
just before you walked
me over to my desk?

638
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,648
Yeah.

639
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,860
"Enjoy this moment, because you're
never going to go back to this time

640
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,363
"before you met
your desk-mate, Dwight."

641
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:33,032
And that's why
I knew. You?

642
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,577
You came up to
my desk and you said,

643
00:32:35,661 --> 00:32:40,161
"This might sound weird, and
there's no reason for me to know this,

644
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:43,668
"but that mixed-berry yogurt
you're about to eat has expired."

645
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,920
That was the moment
that you knew you liked me?

646
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,089
Yup.

647
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,424
Wow.

648
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,719
Can we make it
a different moment?

649
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:52,928
Nope.

650
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,348
Can I start talking?

651
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:01,394
Is this thing on? Give me a
signal when you want me to start.

652
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:08,106
And now from my old hometown,
Scranton, Pennsylvania, my former boss,

653
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,986
Michael Scott.

654
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,989
Hey, I just think
you should know

655
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:15,033
that one of my salesmen
beat your stupid computer.

656
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:16,743
So take that,.

657
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:20,830
Always a jokester.

658
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,585
How about that image?
Crystal clear.

659
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,924
If anyone out there is listening, I
am being held here against my will.

660
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,217
I'm a minor.

661
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,223
Ow!

662
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,473
What are you doing?

663
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,475
You said your
upper back itched.

664
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,102
I didn't ask you
to scratch it.

665
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,479
Look, Angela, I know this is
weird because we work together,

666
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:49,063
and because up until and possibly
including now I've repulsed you,

667
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:50,610
but I like you.

668
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:52,404
I'm not dating you.

669
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,617
So Angela is
stubborn as a mule.

670
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,248
She's giving off fairly strong
vibes that she's not interested.

671
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,088
But do I like her or not?

672
00:34:10,297 --> 00:34:14,551
Because if I like her,
then I can't back down.

673
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,765
If you're going number one,
you've got 10 more seconds.

674
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,852
Hey, have you seen Jim?

675
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,356
I guess he wanted to get out
of here before the cops find out.

676
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,654
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm just scaring him.

677
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:36,322
Now the trick is to make him think
you're going to do something to him.

678
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,574
I can hear you, man.
Shut up,

679
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,950
or I'm going to
punch you in the throat!

680
00:34:39,034 --> 00:34:40,577
Hey, hey, hey,
stop it. Stop it.

681
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,954
No. God.
Oh, my God.

682
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,876
Oh, my God.
Oh, no. No.

683
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,463
I kidnapped a kid.
You had to.

684
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,298
What other choice
did you have?

685
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,509
I could have
paid for the pizza.

686
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,053
Well, yeah.

687
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,851
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

688
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,605
This is Michael.

689
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,772
Hello, Michael.
This is Ryan.

690
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,399
First off, thanks
for the shout out.

691
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:12,108
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

692
00:35:12,192 --> 00:35:14,277
And why is there
a kid on your webcam

693
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,613
saying that he's
being held against his...

694
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,824
Okay.

695
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:22,160
I want you to go in there

696
00:35:22,244 --> 00:35:26,248
and pay him for the pizzas
and give him a generous tip,

697
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,583
no more than 10%.

698
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:29,793
What will you do?

699
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:32,587
I will open the door.

700
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,547
Yeah.

701
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,717
And hopefully
he will walk out.

702
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,346
And the rest
is out of our hands.

703
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,392
So I'm paying full price?

704
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,560
Yes.

705
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,981
Here we go, 65.
You know what?

706
00:35:52,107 --> 00:35:53,483
Here's two more.

707
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,407
See you.
Drive safely.

708
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:04,452
Okay.

709
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,580
Now what?

710
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,416
Now we wait and hope
that nothing happens.

711
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:13,295
All right. I assume I'm going
to be reimbursed for the pizzas?

712
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,589
Not now, Dwight.
Please, not the time.

713
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:20,135
A toast.

714
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,970
I'm gonna make it good.

715
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:25,307
To avoiding a
class-two felony charge.

716
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,233
Hello? Hey.
Hang on a second.

717
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:44,409
Hello. Hang on.

718
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,090
If you change your mind

719
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,468
I'll be first in line

720
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,052
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

721
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,475
If you need me, let me know

722
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,227
Going to be around

723
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,021
If you got no place to go

724
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:17,567
If you're feeling down,
if you're all alone

725
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,986
When the pretty birds
have flown

726
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,570
Honey, I'm still free
Take a chance on me

727
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:29,246
Going to do my very best
And that ain't no lie

728
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:33,791
If you put me to the test,
if you let me try

729
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:38,046
Take a chance on me

730
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,132
That's all I ask of you,
Angela.

731
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:45,299
Take a chance, take a chance

732
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:50,308
On

733
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:54,892
Me

734
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,411
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Yeah. What did she say?

735
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,121
I don't know yet.

736
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,206
I have to call you back.

737
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:13,290
Come on,
you gotta give us something.

738
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:14,791
I'll call you back.

739
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,962
I have to go clean up
after the party.

740
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:39,024
What a horrible day.

741
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,616
Well, I need to get the horrible
taste of this pizza out of my mouth.

742
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,827
I'd really like some sushi.

743
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,456
I was hoping that I would have
New York-style sushi today,

744
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,625
and you know what?

745
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,459
What?
I'm gonna get it.

746
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,087
Coopers has calamari.

747
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:04,507
No. There's only one place to
get authentic New York-style sushi.

748
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:06,050
Tokyo?
New York.

749
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,636
Wanna go?
Yes.

750
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,721
All right.
You drive.

751
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,014
Okay.

752
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,140
Nice.

753
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,600
Here we go.

754
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,143
Mmm.

755
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,145
Perfect.
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,147
You guys are going
to have to leave.

757
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,274
Hey.
You know what?

758
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,404
Come on,
come on, let's go.

759
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,708
Hey, you're the
Scranton guy?

760
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:38,792
Guilty.

761
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,128
I liked your
statement tonight.

762
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:42,879
Thanks.

763
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,174
This is the guy that
beat the computer.

764
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,511
Very cool. Yeah, it was funny to
see Ryan all embarrassed by that.

765
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,513
Yeah.
Yeah.

766
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,889
See you later.

767
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,975
Later on.

768
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:01,185
I'm Ryan and tonight
didn't go the way that I thought it would,

769
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,524
because it didn't work out for
me, and I'm very embarrassed.

770
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,572
I have egg all over my face.

771
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,115
I'm 12 years old.

772
00:40:10,198 --> 00:40:12,867
I spent so much time in Scranton,
but I never sold any paper.

773
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:15,912
I never sold any paper
because I'm an idiot.

774
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,665
I started a fire
with my cheese pita.

775
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,751
I dated an Indian girl.

776
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:22,585
I started a fire.

777
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:23,670
I started a fire.

778
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,838
Now I've got a beard.

779
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,381
And I got a new suit,
and I'm your boss.

780
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,049
I get everything
I want 'cause I'm very...

781
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:29,801
I'm hot. I'm so hot.

782
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,094
That's why everybody...

783
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,429
I didn't get...

784
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,971
I don't
understand that.

785
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,224
That's part of it,
just a...

786
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,159
Wanna head back?

787
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:57,328
Yeah, let's go.
