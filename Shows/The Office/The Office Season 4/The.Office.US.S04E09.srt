1
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,086
Yeah. Everything. It's all
good. It's all good. Phyllis.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,212
Dancing babies.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,797
Dancing babies.
I love it. I love it.

4
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:10,009
We are making a
commercial for Dunder Mifflin today,

5
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,426
our first ad ever.

6
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:14,012
Corporate purchased
some airtime in local markets

7
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:15,889
to spread the word
about Dunder Mifflin Infinity,

8
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:19,476
and they are even sending
up a professional ad company

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,897
to help us make it later.
So it's not too shabby.

10
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,983
Best ad ever?

11
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,153
Give me a
break, give me a break

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,530
Break me off
a piece of that

13
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,495
I am totally blanking.
What is the thing?

14
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:38,745
Nobody tell him.

15
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,539
What?
No. Why?

16
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,957
You got it.
You're so close.

17
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,043
Break
me off a piece of that

18
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,296
Applesauce

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,883
"Break me off a piece of that
applesauce." I don't think so.

20
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,760
A piece
of that Chrysler car

21
00:00:52,843 --> 00:00:53,885
Nope.

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,137
Football cream

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,764
Okay.
It's football cream.

24
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:59,558
It's football cream. All
right, so, anybody else?

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,936
I'm taking a computer animation
class, so I can try to do a logo.

26
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,062
Look at that.

27
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:07,524
Even the receptionist is getting in on
the creativity. Very good. Very good.

28
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,859
Hello. Hello.

29
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,194
Hey. How you doing?
Michael Scott.

30
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,445
Hey, Michael.
Regional manager.

31
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,239
Hi, Michael. Nice to meet
you. Excited to talk ideas.

32
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,406
Us, too, man.
You know what,

33
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,701
I want this to be cutting
edge. I want it to be fast.

34
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:21,246
Quick cuts, you know?
Youthful, sort of a

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,581
MTV-on-crack
kind of thing.

36
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,707
That sounds great.

37
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,210
All right. Good. Well, this is
what we have to work with.

38
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,964
I would like you to meet
Andrew Bernard, the Nard Dog.

39
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,631
Who let
the Nard dog out?

40
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,344
He gives the best
back rubs in the office.

41
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,347
That's true, I give a mean back
rub. Also do good aromatherapy.

42
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,184
You just got
Nard-dogged!

43
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,768
Now, this gentleman right
here is the key to our urban vibe.

44
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,651
Urban? I grew
up in a small town.

45
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,945
What about me
seems urban to you?

46
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,113
Stanley is hilarious.

47
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,990
Phyllis is like
our Mrs. Butterworth.

48
00:01:57,074 --> 00:01:59,159
Kind of a less
urban Aunt Jemima.

49
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
These are our accountants.

50
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,330
And as you can see, they
are very different sizes.

51
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,379
What you might
want to do is kind of

52
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,466
a Papa Bear, Mama
Bear, Baby Bear thing.

53
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:14,633
That might be
kind of fun.

54
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,843
Mama Bear.

55
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,927
Who else?

56
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,346
I think it's great that the
company's making a commercial,

57
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,558
because not very many
people have heard of us.

58
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,935
I mean, when I tell people
that I work at Dunder Mifflin,

59
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,519
they think that we sell mufflers
or muffins or mittens or...

60
00:02:31,817 --> 00:02:35,445
And frankly all of those sound
better than paper, so I let it slide.

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,736
You playing
that game again?

62
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,241
Second Life is not a game. It is
a multi-user virtual environment.

63
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,117
It doesn't have
points or scores.

64
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,869
It doesn't have
winners or losers.

65
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,329
Oh, it has losers.

66
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,498
I signed up for Second
Life about a year ago.

67
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,918
Back then, my life was so great
that I literally wanted a second one.

68
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,879
In my second life,
I was also a paper salesman

69
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,799
and I was also
named Dwight.

70
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,675
Absolutely everything
was the same.

71
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,178
Except I could fly.

72
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,307
Little girl in a field
holding a flower.

73
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,061
We zoom back to find
that she's in the desert

74
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,813
and the field
IS an oasis.

75
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,899
We zoom
back further,

76
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:58,483
the desert is a sandbox in
the world's largest resort hotel.

77
00:03:58,904 --> 00:04:03,404
Zoom back further, the hotel
is actually the playground

78
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,829
of the world's
largest prison.

79
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,998
But we zoom back
further... Okay,

80
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,457
I can tell that your
time is valuable...

81
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,959
Actually,

82
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,253
I don't get paid by the hour
anymore, but thank you.

83
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,046
I get paid
by the year.

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,215
That all sounds really,
really ambitious. So...

85
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,550
Yeah. I know.

86
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,010
Why don't we show you what
we did with the Nashua branch?

87
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,095
Mmm...

88
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,805
Okay.

89
00:04:56,378 --> 00:04:58,046
That's what Nashua
came up with?

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,173
That sucks. Wow.

91
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,676
That's what we
came up with.

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,178
Well, we can do
better than that.

93
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,471
Well, the main part of the ad
has to stay the same, actually.

94
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,849
Yeah, it's the last five seconds
where we have some leeway.

95
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,811
The waving?

96
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,272
Well, no, no. You don't have to be
waving. That was just what they did.

97
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,107
You guys can
be clapping

98
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,110
or sitting, standing
outside, inside, whatever.

99
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,696
And this is where you
really get to be creative.

100
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:27,947
I need some advice. I've been spending a
lot of time making out with Angela lately.

101
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:32,081
We've been necking.
But only necking. Right?

102
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:36,418
Not actually
kissing our mouths.

103
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,378
Just neck on neck.

104
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:42,799
It's just like rubbing/nuzzling
our necks together.

105
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:46,219
It's hot. I'm not gonna lie
to you, but it's a little weird.

106
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,471
But you seem like
a guy with answers.

107
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,850
So how do I fast track
this, get to first base?

108
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,227
We cannot
talk about this,

109
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:58,941
because someone
might hear us.

110
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,152
We'll use code names.

111
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:07,737
Angela can stay the same,
but we'll change Andy to Dwight.

112
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,037
That's not
different enough.

113
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,414
Dwike?

114
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,962
You have a call
from Eddie Murphy.

115
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:26,259
Hello.

116
00:06:26,343 --> 00:06:28,803
MICHAEL IMITATING EDDIE MURPHY ON
SPEAKERPHONE: Shrek. Shrek. I'm a donkey.

117
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,306
I'm a donkey, Shrek.

118
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,018
I'm just kidding.
It's me. Hello, Ry.

119
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,646
What?
Okay, calm down.

120
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,022
I just have
a small problem.

121
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,816
I told you not to
call about small problems.

122
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,277
Yeah. Well, when I
call about big problems,

123
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,654
you don't like that either,
so make up your mind, kiddo.

124
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:51,239
Here is the deal, the ad guys that
you sent are locking me in a creative box

125
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,746
and sort of
ignoring my ideas.

126
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,748
That's good. They're
creative. You're not.

127
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,251
I'm creative, Ryan.

128
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,794
It's not part
of your job.

129
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,379
It's, like,
maybe you can COOK,

130
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,923
but that doesn't mean you
should start a restaurant.

131
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,426
Well, actually I can't cook
and I am starting a restaurant,

132
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:09,135
Mike's Cereal Shack.

133
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,140
I'm thinking we'll have as many
varieties as you can buy in the store.

134
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:14,974
Okay. I'm not really
interested in that right now.

135
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,894
I'm delegating creativity
to creative professionals.

136
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,145
It's a different
skill set.

137
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,147
Look, I wasn't good
at sales, right? Yeah!

138
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,191
But I'm good at managing
people who do sales.

139
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,528
Are you? I don't think you're
doing such a great job here,

140
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,989
suppressing ideas
and creativity.

141
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,743
All right, let me ask you this.
Tell me if you think this is creative.

142
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:34,452
When I was five,

143
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:39,040
I imagined that there was
such a thing as a unicorn.

144
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:44,004
And this was before I had
even heard of one or seen one.

145
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,841
I just drew
a picture of a horse

146
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,304
that could fly over rainbows
and had a huge spike in its head.

147
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,724
I was five,
five years old.

148
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:58,893
Couldn't even talk yet.

149
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,480
Hey, guys. You know what?
We cannot shoot this ad today.

150
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,111
Okay, when should we come back?

151
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:11,281
How about
never-hundred hours, sir?

152
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,408
Wait, we were
sent here to help...

153
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:15,160
I'm not gonna
argue with this guy.

154
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,411
Let's go.

155
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,746
Good luck, dude.
Hey, thanks.

156
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,039
Thank you.
Thank you.

157
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,541
Michael,
David Wallace.

158
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:23,001
What is this about
dismissing the ad people?

159
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,838
Yeah. I'm glad you called.
Ryan is being a little bitch again.

160
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,048
I'm on, Michael.

161
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,008
What's up,
my brother?

162
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,759
Listen, David, I would
like to do this ad in-house.

163
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,347
I want to use only the creativity
that we have right here in the office,

164
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,103
and I will send it to
you tomorrow morning.

165
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,440
Take a look at it. If you do
not think that it's ready to air,

166
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,109
send the ad agency
back down here

167
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,528
and we'll do it
on my dime.

168
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,281
This is weird.

169
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,493
I'm willing to stake
my entire reputation on it.

170
00:08:57,202 --> 00:08:59,996
Okay. I'll see
you tomorrow.

171
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,289
<i>Okay. -.</i>

172
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:07,087
And thus Michael Scott
sealed his own destiny.

173
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,258
In a good way.

174
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:16,721
Has anyone ever come up to
you and said, "You're not creative"?

175
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,640
Yes.

176
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,393
Well, they're wrong.
You are creative.

177
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,396
You are damn creative,
each and every one of you.

178
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,690
You are so much
more creative

179
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,486
than all of the other dry, boring
morons that you work with.

180
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:33,154
Who are you talking to,
specifically?

181
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,867
I kind of know what it's
like to be in commercials.

182
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,370
My nickname in high school
used to be Kool-Aid Man.

183
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,000
When I was younger I always
wanted to be an actor in commercials,

184
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,002
then I realized
I had a brain.

185
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:51,172
I'm excited about doing the ad, but
I'm not really used to doing videos

186
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,258
with so many
people around.

187
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,303
We have three scenes
to film, big scenes.

188
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:58,513
We have a song to write,
so let's get cracking.

189
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,473
Kelly, I want you
to do makeup.

190
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:04,435
Oscar, I would like you to
do costume design, obviously.

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,979
Phyllis, I'd like you
to look around town

192
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,191
and see if we have any
celebrities in our local area.

193
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,193
Sue Grafton is at
the Steamtown Mall.

194
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,820
She's doing a book
signing right now.

195
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,697
Okay, okay. Phyllis, this
is what I want you to do.

196
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,825
I want you to go down to the
mall. I want you to get in line.

197
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,995
I want you to get her
to be in this commercial.

198
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,625
This would be a huge
coup, people. All right?

199
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,876
Do not take no for
an answer. Okay.

200
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,171
Does anyone actually know
what Sue Grafton looks like?

201
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,547
I mean is she hot, or...

202
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,299
She's crazy hot.

203
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,928
Well, then maybe we should just
use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton.

204
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:39,178
Would anyone notice?

205
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,305
That's not happening.

206
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:43,182
I find the mystery
genre disgusting.

207
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,309
I hate being titillated.

208
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,811
Bye, everyone.

209
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,146
Light it up, Phyllis.
Get her, Phyl.

210
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,241
Out of paper, out of stock

211
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,369
Those friendly faces
around the block

212
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,746
Break loose
from the chains

213
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,041
That are causing
you pain

214
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,294
Call Michael
and Stanley, Jim, Dwight, Creed

215
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:14,756
Call Andy and Kelly
For your business paper needs

216
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,216

217
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,968
The people person's
paper people

218
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:19,343

219
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,679
The people person's
paper people

220
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,973
Time out. Time out.
Time out. I thought...

221
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:27,769
I was under the impression
that this was going to be a rap.

222
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,145
What's rap?

223
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,689
Okay, Darryl, wow.

224
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,608
You need to learn a lot
about your own culture.

225
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,818
I'll make you a mix.

226
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,194
Great.

227
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:45,491
News flash. I got some juicy
updates on Operation Fallen Angel.

228
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,749
Remind me to
tell you later.

229
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,505
Hey.

230
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,340
No talk.
I'm animating.

231
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,801
Why don't we take a quick
10-second break from that

232
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,761
so I can show you
what's going on here.

233
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,515
Okay, this is Dwight's Second
Life. He's on it all the time.

234
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,561
So much so that his little guy
here has created his own world.

235
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,271
It's called
Second Second Life

236
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,316
for those people who want to be
removed even further from reality.

237
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,691
Are you serious?
Yeah.

238
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,111
Oh, my God.
He's really in pain.

239
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,154
Who's that?

240
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,741
Oh, it's just my
avatar guy. Whatever.

241
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:24,826
He looks
a lot like you.

242
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,162
Yeah. How much time
did you spend on that?

243
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,540
Not much. It's just for
tracking Dwight, so...

244
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,668
Right. You're a sports
writer in Philadelphia?

245
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,087
Nice build, too.

246
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:37,839
Yep.

247
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,591
You have a guitar
slung on your back.

248
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,760
I did not know
you played guitar.

249
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,096
I...

250
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,765
Why don't we go back to
the animation? No, no, no.

251
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,559
I want to see more of Philly
Jim. No, show me how this...

252
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,769
I want Philly Jim.

253
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,061
Show me
how this works.

254
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,271
Oh, boy.

255
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,655
Out of
paper, out of stock

256
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:07,160
Those friendly faces
around the block

257
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,287
Break loose from the chains

258
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,873
That are causing you pain

259
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,042
Call Michael, Stanley,
Jim, Dwight and Creed

260
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,294
Call Andy and Kelly

261
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,671
Call Dunder Mifflin

262
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,174
People
person's paper people

263
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,093
Dunder Mifflin

264
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,343
It's the people
person's paper people

265
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,888
Stop, stop, stop.

266
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,974
This is not me. This is
not... It's not my music.

267
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,810
You're right. It's
better than you. It's us.

268
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:34,812
Dunder Mifflin

269
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:35,938
The people person's
paper people

270
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,108
No, no, no. I
hate it! I hate it.

271
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:43,487
I don't hate it. I just don't
like it at all, and it's terrible.

272
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,200
You're on your own, Mike.

273
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,828
Okay, you know what?
Hold on, hold on, Darryl.

274
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,454
You just said
you hated it.

275
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:54,040
You said you hated it.
I said I hate the style.

276
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,377
Break me off
a piece of that lumber tar

277
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,878
Snickers bar

278
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:02,465
Okay. Wow. Wow.
This looks terrible.

279
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,092
Break me off a
piece of that Grey Poupon

280
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,761
Andy. Andy. This is a
pivotal scene in the ad.

281
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,138
And if we don't get this,
if we don't nail it,

282
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,641
we're gonna lose the
whole triumph of the moment.

283
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:16,225
The triumph of the will. Now,
God, what? What, Phyllis?

284
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,940
Well, I got in line
to buy Sue Grafton's book

285
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,359
and when it came
to my turn,

286
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,529
I asked her if she wanted to be in
the ad, and she said, "No, thank you."

287
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,573
But I wasn't supposed
to take no for an answer...

288
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,157
Attagirl.
...so I kept on asking,

289
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:32,036
and they finally threw me out of
the store in front of all my friends.

290
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,330
Okay.

291
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,709
Did you or did you
not get Sue Grafton?

292
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,670
No.

293
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,047
Oh, you're...

294
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,591
Can somebody give
her a tissue? Please?

295
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,223
I hope you're not killing yourself on
this, because I'm sure it's good enough

296
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:54,809
for Michael's ad that will
probably be seen by no one.

297
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,604
Maybe. But it's not
good enough for me yet.

298
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,605
Okay. Do you want me to stay?

299
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:02,191
No, no, you can
go home. I'm good.

300
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:06,278
Pam is staying late tonight
to achieve her dreams,

301
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,490
so I'm pretty
proud of her.

302
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:09,782
Unfortunately,
she was my ride home.

303
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:11,742
You coming?

304
00:15:12,994 --> 00:15:14,245
I...

305
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,289
Piss or get
off the pot!

306
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,589
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

307
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,549
Good morning.

308
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,638
Yeah, I'm sorry. I
looked away for a second,

309
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,973
and Creed snatched
your hash browns.

310
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,558
Thank you.
You're welcome.

311
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,269
I worked until
about 2:45 a.m.,

312
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,856
and then I had to decide if I wanted
to spend the night with Michael

313
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,277
editing in his office and Dwight
watching Michael edit in his office,

314
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,738
or drive home and probably
fall asleep at the wheel

315
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,156
and die in
a fiery car wreck.

316
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,409
I passed out on my
keyboard trying to decide.

317
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,788
Let me pour
you some bubbly,

318
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,375
because somebody got to
a whole new level last night.

319
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,043
Andy, I can't
hear this right now.

320
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,878
No. No. No.
This is good.

321
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,463
You know how we haven't
really gotten anywhere

322
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,715
that I want to get
to physically yet?

323
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,010
Well, last night,
that changed.

324
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:14,514
We're making out. I'm
kissing her neck and her cheek

325
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,143
and her ear lobe, and she's
not really kissing me back,

326
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,896
but she closes her
eyes and she's like,

327
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,024
"Oh, D. Oh, D."

328
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,821
She called you D?

329
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,949
Yeah.
D for Andy.

330
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,161
Oh, D.

331
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,413
Oh, D.

332
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,373
Oh, D.

333
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,709
Oh, D.

334
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,960
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

335
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,633
Oh, D!
Oh, D!

336
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:57,594
I'm about to send
the ad to corporate. And it is sent.

337
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,729
They'll probably watch
it right away. I would.

338
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,189
Okay.

339
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,988
Yes? Pam, please
clear my phone lines.

340
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,239
Certainly.

341
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,578
Okay, clear.

342
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,915
They could call
any second now.

343
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:26,961
Oh, God.

344
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,095
I better call.

345
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:42,977
Well, it's been tough.

346
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,230
The geniuses at corporate
rejected my commercial,

347
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,733
and tonight they are airing
the brain-dead version.

348
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,860
So welcome
one and all

349
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,155
to the world premiere
of corporate crap fest.

350
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,218
Hey, seemed
like a big hit.

351
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,720
No.
People are stupid.

352
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:20,973
People like waving.
Waving sells, not art.

353
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,436
The ad we made, our ad,
the real one,

354
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,020
was full of humor and full of depth
and full of heart, and it was real.

355
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:36,322
Hey, could you do me a favor?
Could you put that in the DVD player?

356
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,282
Hey, everybody, I just
want to welcome you all

357
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:42,244
to the premiere of the real
Dunder Mifflin commercial.

358
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,832
The Michael Scott
director's cut. Hope you like it.

359
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,837
It all
starts with an idea.

360
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:55,299
But you can never tell
where an idea will end up.

361
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,264
Because ideas spread.

362
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,475
They change, grow.

363
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,479
They connect us
with the world.

364
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,155
And in a fast-moving world,

365
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:20,115
where good news moves
at the speed of time,

366
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:29,667
and bad news isn't
always what it seems.

367
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,932
Because when push
comes to shove,

368
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,398
we all deserve
a second chance

369
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:58,279
lo score.

370
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,624
Dunder Mifflin. Limitless
paper in a paperless world.

371
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,721
Animation, all her,
by the way. Really?

372
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, I just thought...
The animation was cool.

373
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,808
Thanks.

374
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,476
Hey, listen, you ever been
on a motorcycle because...

375
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,396
Michael, that was fun.

376
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,731
That was fun.

377
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,568
Next round of drinks
IS on me, people.

378
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,823
Claude Van Damme

379
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,036
Hair for men

380
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,580
Poison gas, NutraSweet

381
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,207
It's got to rhyme
with "piece."

382
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,584
Fancy Feast.

383
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:56,420
Break me off
a piece of that Fancy Feast

384
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,340
It's the cat food.
Nailed it.
