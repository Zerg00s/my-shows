1
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:05,129
Hey. Ready?

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,674
Come on.
Show me excited.

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:13,137
Yes. Yeah, I'm
pretty excited, too.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,599
Today, I'm headed over to the
job fair at Valley View High School

5
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,101
to find some
new interns.

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,437
Want to get
some fresh blood.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,064
Youth-anize this place.

8
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,440
Hey, we doing this thing?
Yeah.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,236
Oh, my God, Darryl. You
look like Barack Obama.

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,529
Everybody, I'm
dating Barack Obama.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,280
Why are you dressed
like that? Like what?

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,324
Like you're applying
for a loan?

13
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,826
Maybe he's going
to church or court.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,411
Figured I'd look
presentable. Yeah.

15
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:39,747
You went
a different way.

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,249
- I think you look nice.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,833
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

18
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,295
I am going to instruct the kids
about management and sales.

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,506
Oscar will be in
charge of accounting,

20
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,967
Pam will be
eye candy.

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,679
No, and also because
that is your alma mater.

22
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:57,181
Darryl will hire some
kids for the warehouse.

23
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,350
We don't have to worry
about internships with them,

24
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,227
because they definitely
ain't going to college.

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,187
What college did
you go to, Mike?

26
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,522
Let's go!

27
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,099
Today, I am meeting a
potential client on the golf course

28
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:42,977
because Ryan put
me on probation.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,896
You remember Ryan,
he was the temp here.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,359
Yeah. And it is not a good
time for me to lose my job,

31
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,614
since I have some pretty big long
term plans in my personal life with Pam,

32
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,741
that I'd like her parents
to be psyched about.

33
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:01,162
So I'm about to do something very bold
at this job, that I've never done before.

34
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,456
Try.

35
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,461
Mr. Maguire, it's
been a couple of years.

36
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,421
Hey, Jim. How are
you? Nice to see you.

37
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,549
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

38
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,136
My grandfather would be
spinning in his urn

39
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,430
if he knew that I was out
here with a Dartmouth boy.

40
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:22,767
You take that shirt off right
now, or I will take it off for you, sir.

41
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,603
I am totally and
completely kidding!

42
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,898
Andrew
Bernard, Cornell, '95.

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,858
Phil Maguire,
Dartmouth, '74.

44
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:31,942
Got some blistees.

45
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,110
Yeah, you do.

46
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,905
Hit about twelve hundred balls
last night in preparation for today,

47
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,157
so hands are
a little tender.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,452
It's actually not funny at
all. It's incredibly painful.

49
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:44,413
Yeah, let's make it interesting.
Say, 10 bucks a hole?

50
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,499
Great. What are
we talking? Skins?

51
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,834
Acey Ducey?
Bingo Bango Bongo?

52
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,004
Sandies? Barkies?
Arnies? Wolf? What?

53
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:56,676
I'm going to take this petty
cash that I got from Oscar

54
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,595
and turn it into
next month's rent.

55
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,894
So many
memories in this old gym.

56
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:10,356
Pretending to have PMS, so
I didn't have to play volleyball.

57
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,150
Pretending to have PMS, so I
didn't have to play basketball.

58
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,028
Those were the days.

59
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:22,785
Little over the top,
don't you think?

60
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,329
Show them what
you brought, Mike.

61
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,790
That's all we brought.
This is all we need.

62
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,334
We'll see.
Yes, we will see, Oscar.

63
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:36,215
We will see, because a blank sheet
of paper equals endless possibilities.

64
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,509
Conceptual.
All right.

65
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:42,221
We are open
for business.

66
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,184
Hello.

67
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,066
Andy, you're up.
Let's go.

68
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,901
Giddy up.
Let's do this.

69
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,945
People assume
I'm great at golf,

70
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:01,073
but, like everybody, I hated
golf lessons when I was a kid,

71
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,744
so I used to just hang out
with the sailing club instead.

72
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,662
Got my knot on.

73
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:09,915
Damn it!

74
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,504
Guys, do we have
to stay all day?

75
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,715
I mean, Michael's gone.
Can't we just go?

76
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,675
Yeah, and I finished
my work months ago.

77
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,844
Okay,
excuse me, people.

78
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:24,388
It has come to my attention
that some of you have forgotten

79
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,056
who is
in charge here.

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,685
When Michael is gone,
Jim is in charge.

81
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,271
When Jim is gone,
Andy and I are in charge.

82
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:35,649
When Andy is gone,
you answer to me.

83
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,276
Okay?

84
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,278
Excuse me, where do
you think you're going?

85
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,697
Oh, no, no, no.
You are not leaving.

86
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,742
No! Stanley, do not
walk out that door.

87
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,953
If you walk out that door,
so help me, I will...

88
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,041
He left.

89
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:57,004
Last time I checked, the American
work day ends at 5:00 p.m.

90
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,800
You will all stay at your
desks until that time.

91
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,469
Or you will suffer
the consequences.

92
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,262
What consequences?

93
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,140
I will tell on you.

94
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,269
There is some filing,
restocking of the supply shelves,

95
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,564
replacing the water jug,
which nobody likes to do.

96
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:20,152
We eat a lot of cake.

97
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,404
Cool.

98
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,407
Yeah, and, you know, you
basically learn how an office runs.

99
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,619
Hello. Hi, can I
talk to you for a sec? So...

100
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,788
Excuse me. This is
Michael, my boss. Justin.

101
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:34,834
Hey. Remember what we talked
about in the car, on the way out?

102
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,628
"Only the best
and the brightest."

103
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,296
He's nice, and
he seems interested.

104
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,924
He's totally
wrong, Pam.

105
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,467
Hey.

106
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,473
How you doing? Listen, I don't
think that a handsome, funny, smart,

107
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,351
funny-looking kid like
you should limit himself.

108
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:55,271
You could do whatever you want
to do. You could be a classy janitor

109
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,065
or a cashier
with dignity

110
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:01,986
or a migraine worker.

111
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,282
Maybe, for you, paper
should be more of a hobby.

112
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,449
Sorry for wasting
your time.

113
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,909
Oh, no problem.

114
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:13,163
And he signed. Did he put
his name on the piece of...

115
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,167
Okay, that was supposed
to be a blank canvas

116
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,420
on which to put
their hopes and dreams,

117
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:23,632
and he just made it into
a stupid piece of paper.

118
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,926
We need another one.
Immediately.

119
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,970
Yeah, the booth
is lame without it.

120
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:29,221
I only brought
the one.

121
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,432
Are you mental?

122
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:33,434
Michael, do you remember
you specifically told me

123
00:06:33,517 --> 00:06:35,561
to only bring one
sheet of paper?

124
00:06:35,644 --> 00:06:37,688
You said it only takes one
sheet to make a difference,

125
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:41,275
and I said, "Are you sure, Michael?"
And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam.,"

126
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:44,820
and then you sneezed in my tea, and then you
said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies."

127
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,406
Do you remember that? I don't.

128
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,037
Okay, I'll go look
for another one.

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,625
And that is why
I need a smart intern.

130
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,462
Hey, so, how's the direct
mail business going?

131
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,631
I can't complain. People
love their junk mail.

132
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,300
Now, are you getting all
your paper from PPC or...

133
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:10,012
You know what, Jim? I'm not really
looking to change things up right now.

134
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,181
I just came out here to get
out of the office a little bit,

135
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,099
so why don't we
just play, okay?

136
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,851
Absolutely. Will do.

137
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,272
So, I guess I'll just
work on my short game.

138
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,198
Hello there.

139
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:30,866
What is this company?

140
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,537
Well, it's funny that you should ask,
because it's really more than a company.

141
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,081
Dunder Mifflin Paper.

142
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:38,582
Thanks.

143
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,876
Okay.
Damn it, Oscar.

144
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah, I'm trying to lure
these kids into my booth,

145
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,258
but kids are very wary
of being lured these days.

146
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,344
Thank you, Dateline.

147
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,099
Thank you.

148
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,653
Extension 128.

149
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,530
Hiya, pumpkin,
it's Creed.

150
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:12,074
So, we're gonna
ditch this bitch. You in?

151
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,826
Are you out?
No.

152
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:17,871
Pumpkin's out.
Let's go, gang.

153
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,728
My old art room.

154
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,778
Oh, maybe
it's still here.

155
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,868
No, no, they must have
taken it down. Never mind.

156
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,337
What do you want? Michael,
I know you're swamped.

157
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,758
I just thought you should know
that everyone in the office has left,

158
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,468
except for Angela and I.

159
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,887
Do not worry, though. I
have taken down their names,

160
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,889
and I have docked
them a personal day.

161
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:20,559
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not
there. Why should they have to be there?

162
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,645
So, what
else is up?

163
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:27,983
Mike?

164
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,162
Thank you.
What is this?

165
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,956
A piece of paper. This
isn't Dunder Mifflin paper.

166
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,334
This is some sort
of Pendleton crap.

167
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,960
Well, I think they'll
get the spirit of it.

168
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,963
Pam, Pam, Pam!
We're dying here.

169
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:54,093
I want you to go back to the office,
and I want you to get the real stuff.

170
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,303
I want you to get
ultra white card stock.

171
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:57,513
Are you serious?

172
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,598
Yes, and don't
call me Shirley.

173
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:02,476
Okay.

174
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,944
Damn it.

175
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,200
You could just pick it up,
take the triple bogey.

176
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:21,036
Yeah, I'll get it out.
Thank you. Yup.

177
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,693
Oh, man.
Come on, Tuna.

178
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,738
Hey, can't really
talk now. What's up?

179
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,491
Just checking
in. How's it going?

180
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,996
You know, we'll see. We'll see.

181
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,248
I just drove 20 miles
round trip back to the office

182
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,001
to get Michael a single
sheet of white paper.

183
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,921
<i>So, I could've just had
them fax it to me, I guess.</i>

184
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,214
Oh, I like you.

185
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,716
Talk to you later?

186
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,218
Yeah.
All right. Bye.

187
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:26,185
All right.

188
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,937
I'm sorry, I've got to
annoy you one more time.

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,148
What if I bring down
shipping costs?

190
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:34,693
You can try. But I've
looked at your prices.

191
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,737
Even with
free shipping,

192
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,448
doesn't work.

193
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,825
It's just... It's not
in the stars, Jim.

194
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,248
Six. Yeah.
All right.

195
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,210
All right,
race to the next hole.

196
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,128
Winner gets ten bucks.

197
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,880
Wait, wait for me!

198
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,299
Shortcut, shortcut.

199
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,266
I fell in the sand trap.

200
00:12:24,993 --> 00:12:27,788
All of these jobs suck.

201
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,666
I would rather live jobless
on a beach somewhere

202
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,709
off the money from
a large inheritance

203
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,295
than have to work in any
one of these crap holes.

204
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,464
They suck.

205
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,843
Hey, game over.

206
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,893
Just-in time.

207
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,272
Just-in case.
What's your last name?

208
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,818
Polznik.
This just in,

209
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,319
Justin Polznik.

210
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:06,493
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie,
who takes off her glasses and she's hot.

211
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:09,371
And you realize that she was always
hot, she was just wearing glasses,

212
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:11,832
and that you were
the blind one.

213
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,211
He's the most important
thing in my life right now.

214
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,089
I want you to meet
my family. Come on.

215
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,884
Oscar Martinez, accountant
extraordinaire. This is Justin.

216
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,219
Hi.

217
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,472
This is Darryl Philbin.
Isn't he big?

218
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,642
And you already met her.
Pam Beesly, office hottie.

219
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,311
She will do you.

220
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,941
No, no, but she has already dated
two guys in the office that we know of,

221
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,776
so this could be
number three.

222
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,570
You never...
Excuse me.

223
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,990
Come here. I would
never say this to her face,

224
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:47,534
but she is a wonderful
person and a gifted artist.

225
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:49,411
What? Why wouldn't
you say that to her face?

226
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:53,498
So, what do you think?
Think these guys are nice?

227
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,042
The guys I didn't bring
are even better.

228
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,713
Justin, I'm willing
to commit right now.

229
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:04,718
Would you
do me the honor

230
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:08,388
of spending the summer
with us at Dunder Mifflin?

231
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,307
I think you
are very special.

232
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,143
You didn't
want me before.

233
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,519
That's what
you said.

234
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,645
No, I didn't.

235
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,148
You misconstrued. You
were kind of a jerk to me.

236
00:14:18,231 --> 00:14:20,525
And I'm going
to go now.

237
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,235
Why don't... Hey.

238
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,262
Bless you.

239
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,349
Thank you.

240
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:04,027
Okay, Jim, you owe me $120.
And, Phil, you owe me $230.

241
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,323
Let's open a tab, because you and
me are going to be playing more often.

242
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,075
Count me in.
Nope.

243
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:11,785
All right.

244
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:15,997
Okay, you had some fun,
and I think I paid for it.

245
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,376
So let me just get
my last shot in there.

246
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,794
Is there anything
you can do for me?

247
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,045
I'll tell you what.

248
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,216
My fiscal year ends in
two months. Let's talk then.

249
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,592
Sound good?
Absolutely.

250
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,429
Good playing with
you guys. Right on.

251
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:36,518
You know, it's a tough thing,
seeing a grown man take six shots

252
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:40,897
to get out of the sand trap, but I
had to give Phil credit for not quitting.

253
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,774
Which is what I told him.

254
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,901
I also told him that
I don't quit, either.

255
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,738
And I'd call him every single
day until he gave me his business.

256
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:53,577
Which he then did, after fifteen
minutes of me blocking his car.

257
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,288
So I am now
his paper supplier.

258
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:02,043
And I shot a 102 today,
so I'm feeling pretty good.

259
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,714
The job fair will
be closing in five minutes.

260
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:08,592
Eighth period will
commence as scheduled.

261
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,428
Hold down the fort,
I have to do something.

262
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,567
Excuse me.
If you can hear me,

263
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,904
I would like you to look
around at all these companies

264
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:33,992
and know that none of them
are good enough for you.

265
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,661
H&R Block? Come on.

266
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,706
I mean, I don't even
know what they do.

267
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,919
Frank Regan Funeral Home?
Too much formaldehyde.

268
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,545
The Air Force?

269
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,673
Air Force is cool.

270
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:54,221
The refreshments? Bush league,
you know? That's not what you want.

271
00:16:55,305 --> 00:17:01,853
Dunder... Okay, I see security is coming, so
I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin.

272
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,147
Dunder Mifflin,
a great place to work.

273
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,442
Anybody? Show of hands, anybody
want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?

274
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,530
We do not offer college credit,
we cannot give you any sort of pay,

275
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,074
but it is a really fun
work environment.

276
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,577
Anybody? Show of hands.

277
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,623
Damn it. Okay.

278
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:26,962
I'm going to wrap it up here.
Thank you for your time.

279
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,838
And drive safe!

280
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,737
Thank you.
You're welcome.

281
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,004
You realize
you are taking out.

282
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,883
I can't...
Beers?

283
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,261
You closed it?
I closed it.

284
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:17,762
Yes!

285
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,064
Congratulations
to you, sir.

286
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,733
Thank you, thank you
very much. I appreciate it.

287
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:32,193
Well done. Nice job. Thank you.

288
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,321
You know what?
Screw this.

289
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,287
Today,
I did something stupid.

290
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,540
I questioned myself, and
I will never do that again.

291
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,500
Because I look at somebody
like Jim Halpert,

292
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,087
and I think that guy could
do anything he wants to do.

293
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,506
He could do anything,

294
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,427
and he chooses to work
here selling paper.

295
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,305
Just like me.

296
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,892
Yeah. Kiss her.
Kiss her good.

297
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,738
Hello.

298
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,574
I was just wondering, what
kind of jobs do you guys have?

299
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,159
Are you interested
in graphic design?

300
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,619
Yeah.

301
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,663
Can I fill out
an application?

302
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,832
Oh, absolutely.
Here, take a seat.

303
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,543
I should let you know right away
that this is just an entry-level job.

304
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,672
It's really basic. We're
looking for, like, a self starter,

305
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,298
someone who can
meet deadlines

306
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,800
and pretty much just
go the extra mile,

307
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,093
I guess.
I can do that.

308
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:41,388
Great, and, obviously, we're looking
for someone who knows Photoshop,

309
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:47,102
and Dreamweaver, Corel Painter,
Illustrator, After Effects, all the basics.

310
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,521
I don't know
any of those.

311
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,731
It's actually not
super complicated.

312
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,610
I mean, I'm sure there's some sort
of adult education classes in the area.

313
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,071
But if you're really serious
about graphic design,

314
00:19:58,154 --> 00:19:59,656
I would think about
New York or Philadelphia.

315
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,158
They've got amazing programs
out there for design.

316
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,368
New York
or Philadelphia.

317
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,869
Yeah.

318
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,956
All right. Cool.
Well, thanks. Sure.

319
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,916
And I'll look into
those. You should.

320
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,459
New York or
Philadelphia? Absolutely.

321
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,669
Okay. That's
where the action is.

322
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:13,920
Thanks.
